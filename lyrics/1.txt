A lie to say, "O my mountain has coal veins and beds to dig
500 men with axes and they all dig for me"
A lie to say, "O my river where many fish do swim
Half of the catch is mine when you haul your nets in"

Oh no never will he believe that
His greed has a blinding ray
No devil or redeemer will cheat him
He'll take his gold to where he's lying cold

A lie to say, "O my mine gave a diamond big as a fist
But with every gem in his pocket, the jewels he has missed
A lie to say, "O my garden is growing taller by the day
He only eats the best and tosses the rest away

Oh no never will he believe that
His greed has a blinding ray
No devil or redeemer can cheat him
He'll take his gold where he's lying cold
Six deep in the grave

(His oldest pain and fear in life)
Something is out of reach
Something he wanted
(There'll not be time)
(His oldest pain and fear in life)
Something is out of reach

He's being taunted
(There'll not be time, oh no)
Something is out of reach
(Hey, hey)
That he can't beg or steal
(Nor can he buy)

A lie to say "O my forest has trees that block the sun
And when I cut them down I don't answer to anyone"

No, no, no, never will he believe that
His greed has a blinding ray
No devil or redeemer can cheat him
Take his gold where he's lying cold

La la la la la la
La la la la la la
Oh, la la la, la la la la la la la
A lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely man

Well they left then in the morning
A hundred pairs of wings
In the light moved together
In the colors of the morning
I looked to the clouds
In the cirrus sky and they'd gone

Across the marshes
Across the fields below
I fell through the vines
And I hoped they would catch me below

If only to take me with them there
Tell me the part that shines
In your heart on the wind

And the reeds blew in the morning
Take me along to the places
You've gone when my eyes looked away
Tell me the song that you sing
In the trees in the dawning
Tell me the part that shines
In your heart and the rays of love forever
Please take me there
<E>
<S>
She walks alone on the brick lane
The breeze is blowing
A year had changed her forever
Just like her gray home

He used to live so close here
We'd look for places I can't remember
The world was safe when she knew him
She tried to hold him, hold on forever

For all that never happens
And all that never will be
A candle burning for the love we seldom keep

The earth was raw in her fingers
She overturned it
Considered planting some flowers
They wouldn't last long, no one to tend them

It's funny how these things go
You were the answer to all the questions
The memories made her weary
She shuddered slowly, she didn't want to

As a distant summer he began to whisper
And threw a smile her way
She looked into the glass
Liquid surface showing
That they were melding, together present past

So where can I go from here?
The color fading, he didn't answer
She felt him slip from her vision
She tried to hold him, hold on forever
So close forever, in a silent frozen sleep
<E>
<S>
Dance to the sun
A kiss to the earth
Embrace a stone

Come the small black book
Come the brandy cask
One strange disease
The well worded paper
Signed by the drunken
Hands of thieves

And suddenly
They were told to leave

As the snake uncoiled on a road
The length was eighty miles
Wagons' weary horses
Lead the feverish exiles
Barefoot in the early snow
On a ridge
Where they beheld their home
Coarse and barren
Not the haven
Promised by the father

Jaksa chula harjo
Jaksa chula harjo
Jaksa chula harjo

The red sticks first and
The dancing ghosts were
Pierced with arms of fire
And the weeping widows
Left could not avenge
So the western star manifest its will
Drove them clear into the pacific o

Gone the way of flesh
Turned pale and died
By your god's decree

For he hated me
<E>
<S>
For whom the bells toll
When sentenced to die
The stuttering rifles
Will stifle the cry
The monstrous anger
The fear's rapid rattle
A desert inferno
Kids dying like cattle

Don't tell me
We're not prepared
I've seen today's marine
He's eighteen and he's eager
He can be quite mean

No mock'ries for them
No prayers or bells
The demented choirs
The wailing of shells
The boys holding candles
On untraveled roads
The fear spreads like fire
As shrapnel explodes

I think it's wrong
To conscript our youth
Against their will
When plenty of our citizenry
Really like to kill

What sign posts will lead
To armageddon's fires
What bugles will call them
From crowded grey shires
The women sit quiet
With death on their minds
A slow dusk descending
The drawing of blinds

Make the hunters all line up
It's their idea of fun
And let those be forgiven
Who never owned a gun
Was it him or me
Or the wailing of the dead
The laughing soldiers
Cast their lots
And you can cut the dread
<E>
<S>
Wide open falsehood
The clan destine truths
Rival till the end
In a series of duels

Pardon the drapery language I choose
Waltz in Vienna has taught me to use
Every tall room a fiction
Leather bound treasure books

Up to the ceiling
Gold spine upon spine
The guile and the treason
The faith and allegiance

Wide open falsehood
The clan destine truths
Rival till the end
In a series of duels

Pardon the drapery language I choose
The author grew fat to imagine
His lead pen careening
Gave voice to the scheming

An Aryan cabale to dethrone
The guile and the treason
The faith and allegiance
To the empire unknown

The baron and his mistress
Dine in a fine banquet hall
As rebel insurgents plot in
The attic space crawl

Wide open falsehood
The clan destine truths
Rival till the end
In a series of duels

Pardon the drapery language I choose
His small hand did strive to explain
All the rants and raves of a people enslaved
By the cant of the shrewdest capable men

The guile and the treason
The faith and allegiance
Now lie in my hand

The guile and the treason
The faith and allegiance
Now lie in my hand
<E>
<S>
You were looking away from me
Western skies calling you
Colors spilling, running
Dazzling you

I was looking the other way
Voices call from the east
I saw my roots of the trees
There planted at my feet

It could be I'm searching
For a place so small
With room for everything
Where worlds on worlds revolve
But how can we wait?

I wouldn't hold you back

Suppose I was the clever one
And words came easy to me
I could say I was writing a song about you
(You) and me

Maybe that verse is yet to be found
But waits inside of me
A secret room a tangled web to unweave

But how can we wait
Knowing our ways
How can we hold on
Still you know
It's not too late
<E>

Jenny

Jenny you don't know the nights I hide
Below a second story room
To whistle you down
The man who's let to divvy up
Time is a miser
He's got a silver coin
Only lets it shine for hours
While you sleep it away

There's one rare and odd style of living
Part only known to the everybody jenny
A comical where's the end parade
Of the sort people here would think unusual

Jenny

Tonight upon the mock brine of a luna sea
Far off we sail on to back o' the moon

Jenny

Jenny you don't know the days I've tried
Telling backyard tales
So to maybe amuse
O your mood is never giddy
If you smile I'm delighted
But you'd rather pout
Such a lazy child
You dare fold your arms
Tisk and say that I lie

There's one rare and odd style of thinking
Part only known to the everybody jenny
The small step and giant leap takers
Got the head start in the race toward it

Jenny

Tonight upon the mock brine of a luna sea
Far off we sail on to the back o' the moon

That was a sigh
But not meant to envy you
When your age was mine
Some things were sworn true
Morning would come

And calendar pages had
New printed seasons on
Their opposite sides

Jenny

Jenny you don't know the nights I hide
Below a second story room
To whistle you down
O the man who's let to divvy up
Time is a miser
He's got a silver coin
Lets it shine for hours
While you sleep it away

There's one rare and odd style of living

Part only known to the everybody jenny
Out of tin ships jump the bubble head boys
To push their flags into powdered soils and cry
No second placers

No smart looking geese in bonnets
Dance with pigs in high button trousers
No milk pail for the farmer's daughter
No merry towns of sweet walled houses

Here I've found
Back o' the moon
Not here
I've found
Back o' the moon

Take me now, baby, here as I am
Hold me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand, as the sun descends
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Have I doubt, baby, when I'm alone
Love is a ring on the telephone
Love is an angel, disguised as lust
Here in our bed 'til the morning comes

Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand, as the sun descends
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

With love we sleep, with doubt the vicious circle turns, and burns
Without you, I cannot live, forgive the yearning burning
I believe in love too real to feel, take me now, take me now, take me now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Saying anybody saving face belongs to her

I was thinking today if you would remember you choose to remember
What you left me out there in the cold days fading away
I see you so near I hear your voice calling
It calls me from these pages to you beyond the blue,
So sudden too soon the secrets we knew
I was thinking today if you would surrender to feelings
That you tried deserting and if given the choice
I'd still wait for the moment still wait for the moment
When I could have a hero like you days fading away
But I see you so clear I hear your voice calling
It calls me from these pages to you
<E>

I saw a big star running from me
A world from a record on my bed
Turn the tables on me
What would happen if I fell
To the tune of a dreamer
To the tune of my heart?

A big star running from me
I saw a world out sunning on my head
Turn the tables on me now
I would fall from heaven
And ring your bell

Baby, catch me
N the middle of a lie
The boys are out tonight
Yeah the boys are out tonight
The big shots singin' from me
I saw a world out sunning on my head
Pity my heart signals
Center of a storm inside my head
Center of my heart
Center of my out of time simple mind

From the moon out my window
A wink and a blink and a nod
Had a wish on a star but now it's falling
<E>
<S>
Shards of glass cut through my gaze
Broken streamers hanging at my legs
Drunk and giddy full of fate
At the cabaret

Smokey stares from the bar do stray
Bottles tumble, I feel the misty spray
What a perfect, perfect day
For the cabaret

From afar he sees Venus rise
Overwhelmingly beautiful he sighs
The look of love was in her eyes
At the cabaret

Puts his hand upon her leg
Looking closer his lust begins to fade
What a drag the queen did say
At the cabaret

Could this be a dream Im in
Fellini would be proud
Gluttony enfolds the scene
Give 'em one last round

Shining faces dance away
Swinging skirts between the panted legs
Kaleidescoping then shassez
At the cabaret

In a blink the glasses fly
Suddenly joy becomes a fight
There they tossed and turned a sight
At the cabaret

Could this be a dream Im in
Fellini would be proud
Gluttony enfolds the scene
Give 'em one last round, last round, yeah
<E>

If lust and hate is the candy
if blood and love tastes so sweet
then we give 'em what they want
Hey, hey, give 'em what they want

So their eyes are growing hazy 'cause they want to turn it on
so their minds are soft and lazy
Well, hey, give 'em what they want

If lust and hate is the candy
if blood and love tastes so sweet
then we give 'em what they want

So their eyes are growing hazy 'cause they want to turn it on
so their minds are soft and lazy
Well who do you want to blame?

Hey, hey, give 'em what they want

If lust and hate is the candy

So their eyes are growing hazy 'cause they want to turn it on

Well who do you want to blame?

Steep is the water tower
Painted off blue to match the sky

Can't ignore the train

Night walks in the valley silent
You could swear the earth just moved

Can't ignore the train

Dust to be kicked up
In the crack faced
Idle sinister town
Screen door to the rail station
Devil in her shoe

Ran along side the wasted tracks
Hem pins darted her calves

Can't ignore the train

One spoiled girl with the tidiest apology
Some how wedged inside her throat

Can't ignore the train

Patience their virtue
But I never could abide by that
Dungeon life with electric light
A clean towel and a basin
Mantle figures mind their place
Laughs where they belong

Through adventure we are not adventuresome

Rage to share with a wardrobe mirror
In a room so beige and cold

Can't ignore the train

Window days saw the children pick their
Street games on thirty afternoons

Molly the boys are
Starting in the rhymic again
Teasing more and more

The second daughter
How she fell
Young locked in some folk's prison
Made to dwell
Til they're braiding
Her grey hair

Sitting in the wishing chair
<E>
<S>
Over your shoulder, please dont mind me
If my eyes have fallen onto your magazine
Oh, Ive been watching and wondering
Why your face is changing with every line you read

For all those lines and circles to me a mystery
Eve pulled down the apple and gave a taste to me
If she could it would be wonderful
But my pride is in the way
I cannot read to save my life
Im so ashamed to say

I live in silence, afraid to speak
Of my life of darkness because I cannot read

For all those lines and circles to me a mystery
Eve pulled down the apple and gave a taste to me
If she could it would be wonderful
Then I wouldnt need someone elses eyes
To see whats in front of me
No one guiding me

It makes me humble to be so green
At what every kid can do when he learns A to Z

For all those lines and circles just frighten me
And I fear that Ill be trampled if you dont reach for me
Before I run Ill have to take a fall
And when I pick myself up so slowly
Ill devour every one of those
Books in the tower of knowledge
<E>

I dreamed of a circle, I dreamed of a circle round
And in that circle I had made were
All the worlds unformed and unborn yet
A volume, a sphere that was the earth
That was the moon, that did revolve around my room

I dreamed of a circle, I dreamed of a circle round
And in that circle was a maze, a terrible spiral to be lost in
Blind in my fear, I was escaping just by feel
But at every turn my way was sealed

I dreamed of a circle, I dreamed of a circle round
And in that circle was a face
Her eyes looked upon me with fondness
Her warmth coming near, calling me "sweetness," calling me "dear. "
But I whispered, "no, I can't rest here. "

I dreamed of a circle, I dreamed of a circle round

Heaven, is this heaven where we are?
See them walking, if you dare, if you call that walking
Stumble, stagger, fall and drag themselves along the streets of heaven

Where is the blessed table to feed all who hunger on earth
Welcomed and seated each one joyfully served?
See them walking, if you dare, if you call that walking
Stumble, stagger, fall and drag themselves along the streets of heaven

Where is the halo that should glow 'round your face
And where are the wings that should grow from your shoulder blades?
Show them to me
These are sobering sights I've seen in the city of angels
Have all been one rude awakening that was dues to me in heaven

There would have been heavenly music I was convinced before
A host of the dearly to meet me with hosannas sung at the door
But these are sobering sights I've seen in the city of angels
Have all been one rude awakening that was dues to me in heaven
In this city of fallen angels

One time
You made me cry
Be proud that I
Remember

My chin is sore
The bruise is gone
But the spot is tender

Gave my hand a sister coy
To Cotton Alley where
You did enjoy
Your wicked games
You curious boy

Tied my laces up together
When I fell
You laughed
Until your belly was sore

In the brick laid aisle behind
The five and dime store

That's how
I made you blush
But doubt if you
Remember

Were my tears genuine
Or those of a skilled
Pretender

Nothing precious
Plain to see
Don't make a fuss over me
Not loud
Not soft
But somewhere in between
Say sorry
Let it be
The word you mean

I was a little pest who
Never took a hint
Could never
Take a hint

You pinched my fingers
In a door
Tossed my coloring book in a
Rusty barrel

Pulled spiders from my hair
Fingers in the door

My favorite blue blouse
Stained on the back
Running from a berry war

Can you hear me scream
In Cotton Alley
Scream in Cotton Alley
In Cotton Alley
<E>

Like a weasel in the clover
Tilt, toss, pop, turn over
Sit down
Tremble, weave like a moth by flame deceived
Sit down

Like a weasel in the clover
Tilt, toss, pop, turn over
Sit down
Tremble, weave like a moth by flame deceived
Sit down

Spill with your words caught
Dance in your room
Slide like you're buttered up
Roll back the tomb
Sit down
Sit down
Sit down

When the thunder clouds sound
Ants all scatter to high ground
Sit down

Bolt scuff jilt chase
Circle riddle shake in haste
Sit down
Bolt scuff jilt chase
Circle riddle shake in haste
Sit down
Sit down

When the thunder clouds sound
Ants all scatter to high ground
Sit down

Like a weasel in the clover
Tilt, toss, pop, turn over
Sit down
Tremble, weave like a moth by flame deceived
Sit down

Spill with your words caught
Dance in your room
Slide like you're buttered up
Roll back the tomb

Sit down
Sit down

There were women holding rosaries
On the day Manolete died
Teenage girls in soft white dresses
Standing silent peace respecting
Groups of boys held in their hands
The fragments of a shattered idol
The old men with their traditions challenged
Refrained from tears
Neck neck hook
Poles of wood
The Picadores stood eyes ablaze
To view brutal contest
In the vale of years
Courage unfailing
Agility exhausted
Youth entered challenge
Reached for title shelved
Patrons in attendance
To disarm a common myth
Homage played to the victor of immortality
Cloaked in bold tones
In the stockyard the beasts
Did climb their barriers
Bid by a frenzied ring
Bred for one purpose only
To die in man's sport
Dash against his spindle
An instant fell to wounding
On the day
Swords penetrating
On the day
Torches igniting
On the day
Flower wreaths encircling
The day
On the day

Don't talk, I will listen
Don't talk, you keep your distance
For I'd rather hear some truth tonight than entertain your lies
So take you poison silently
Let me be, let me close my eyes

Don't talk, I'll believe it
Don't talk, listen to me instead
I know that if you think of it, both long enough and hard
The drink you drown your troubles in is the trouble you're in now

Talk talk talk about it, if you talk as if you care
But when your talk is over tilt that bottle in the air
Tossing back more than your share

Don't talk, I can guess it
Don't talk, well now you're restless
And you need somewhere to put the blame for how you feel inside
You'll look for a close and easy mark and you'll see me as fair game

Talk talk talk about it, you talk as if you care
But when your talk is over you tilt that bottle in the air
Tossing back more than your share
You talk talk talk about it, you talk as if you care
I'm marking every word and can tell this time for sure
Your talk is the finest I have heard

So don't talk, I was sleeping
Don't talk, let me go on dreaming
How your eyes they glow so fiercely I can tell you're inspired
By the name you just chose for me, now what was it? Oh, never mind it
We will talk talk talk about this when your head is clear
I'll discuss this in the morning, but until then you may talk but I won't hear
<E>
<S>
I should know to leave them home
They follow me through the store with these toys I can't afford
Kids, take them back, you know better than that
Dolls that talk, astronauts, t.v. games, airplanes
They don't understand and how can I explain?

I try and try but I can't save
Pennies, nickels dollars slip away
I've tried and tried but I can't save

My youngest girl has bad fever, sure
All night with alcohol to cool and rub her down
Ruby, I'm tired, try and get some sleep
I'm adding doctor's fees to remedies
With the cost of three day's work lost

I try and try but I can't save
Pennies, nickels, dollars slip away
I've tried and tried but I can't save

The hole in my pocketbook is growing
There's a new wind blowing they say
It's gonna be a cold, cold one
So brace yourselves my darlings
It won't bring anything much our way
But more bust bowl days

I played a card in this weeks game
Took the first and the last letters in three of their names
This lottery's been building up for weeks
I could be lucky me with the five million prize
Tears of disbelief spilling out of my eyes

I try and try but I can't save
Pennies, nickels, dollars slip away
I've tried and tried but I can't save

The hole in my pocketbook is growing
There's a new wind blowing they say
It's gonna be a cold, cold one
So brace yourselves my darlings
It won't bring anything much our way
But more dust bowl days

Oh, baby blankets and baby shoes
Baby slippers, baby spoons, walls of baby blue
Dream child in my head is a nightmare born in a borrowed bed
Now I know lightning strikes again
It struck me once, then struck me dead
My folly grows inside of me

I eat for two, walk for two, breathe for two now
Walk for two, eat for two, breathe for two now

Well, the egg man fell down off his shelf
All the good King's men with all their help
Struggled 'til the end for a shell they couldn't mend
You know where this will lead
To hush and rock in the nursery
For the kicking one inside of me

I eat for two, walk for two, breathe for two now
Eat for two, walk for two, breathe for two now

When the boy was a boy, the girl was a girl
They found each other in a wicked world
Strong in some respects
But she couldn't stand for the way he begged and gave in
Pride is for men, young girls should run and hide instead
Risk the game by taking dares with "yes"

Eat for two, walk for two, breathe for two now
Eat for two, walk for two, breathe for two now

Walk for two? I'm stumbling
Walk for two? I'm stumbling
Breathe for two, how? I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Five months, how it grows
Five months now, I begin to show

We are the roses in the garden, beauty with thorns among our leaves
To pick a rose you ask your hands to bleed
What is the reason for having roses when your blood is shed carelessly?
It must be for something more than vanity

Believe me, the truth is we're not honest, not the people that we dream
We're not as close as we could be
Willing to grow but rains are shallow
Barren and wind-scattered seed on stone and dry land, we will be
Waiting for the light arisen to flood inside the prison
And in that time kind words alone will teach us, no bitterness will reach us
Reason will be guided another way

All in time, but the clock is another demon that devours our time in Eden, in our Paradise
Will our eyes see well beneath us, flowers all divine?
Is there still time?
If we wake and discover in life a precious love, will that waking become more heavenly?
<E>
<S>
Eager to please was just the way that he was
Though his attempts there falling short
Expectation, see he would tell of all his conquests
Was he bragging?

But in the evening all alone, Ellen, unplanned delays
Saving for someone who really cared about you
Invincible they say, married to your name
She was the kind between a child and a lady

Quick was her temper like a blaze from an ember
No one had measured to her standard
So in the evening all alone, all alone
How do I tell them to open their minds and to take a chance?

Maybe on finding lifes treasure
Stubborn they stay set in their ways
Really not wanting to be lonely, not alone
<E>
<S>
Even with my eyes closed
Funny how I know it's harder, it's harder now
Young girl in my
young girl days, thinking I could live for always

But like an ocean tide
I'm drawn back inside and I know

Seasons pass like sand inside a glass
and nothing, nothing returns
Standing with the friends I've made,
I'll race them to the grave
Well who won, won the extra days?

When you take away the years toll
on the waters wide, shallow high and low
In the autumn sky,
happy to know I'm going home
<E>
<S>
Trudging slowly over wet sand
Back to the bench where your clothes were stolen
This is a coastal town
That they forgot to close down
Armageddon come Armageddon come Armageddon come
Everyday is like Sunday
Everyday is silent and grey
Hide on a promenade
Etch on a post card
How I dearly wish I was not here
In the seaside town
That they forgot to bomb
Come, come nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
Everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
And a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"win yourself a cheap tray"
Share some grease tea with me
Everyday is silent and grey

Why are some men born
With minds that earn degrees
The loving cups
Gilded plaques
Grace their study walls
Hide the cracks
While their genius is turned
To works of tyranny then
Off to market to market
Go selling these

With words so fiery and persuasive
They steal cunningly
Riches no one can exceed

And why are some men born
With a fate of poverty
One firm bed
For a swollen back
Year by year
The bodies wracked while
Their obedience is had
With gradual defeat
By the pace by the pace
And the urgency

Through a muddled thought
They phrase it
God knows we're deceived
Barter for
What they need

And where they go
Disdain and jeering
For fools to call
The noble peasantry

O how it puzzles me

I pressed flat the accordion pleats
That had gathered in his cotton sleeves
While he thumbed
Yes, thumbed, I wouldn't say caressed

The final piece
A mountain's crest
Soon to reply assuredly

O for man aged ninety years
No words to waste on sermons
He'd be pleased to answer
Short and sincere

Girl there's a nonsense
In all these heaven measures
It's a heathen creed
So your grandma says
But better to live by...
Drink it all in before it's dry

He ended there with a rattle
Cough, cough
I took away the long gone cold coffee cup
As a trail of Camel ashes fell
On the floor
<E>
<S>
Times are far between and few I bet
We can look upon our lives without regret

Of all the things I have done
You think I'm proud of everyone
Without exception

'Til you make your peace with yesterday
Never build a future I swear by what I say

Whatever penance you do
Decide what it's worth to you
And then respect it

However long it will take
To weather your mistakes
Why not accept it?

My hands for now are tied
I'm a body frozen, I'm a will that's paralyzed
When will you ever set aside your pain and misery?
No matter how I beg, no matter how I wish or plead

You'll never be more than alive
You'll never do more than survive
Until you expect it

Do you want to build a world with our lives?
You better soon decide
Or you can forget it

My hands for now are tied
I'm a body frozen, I'm a will that's paralyzed
'Til you drop that heavy baggage you're dragging behind
There won't be room for us to both go this ride
<E>
<S>
Waking on a train dreaming,
Charmed alone they started speaking.
Captured in his artist way
Before the memories fade away.

To remember a face,
And you're home or want to.

Certain they would meet soon,
Paint a portrait of a family.

Single light on, single way,
Single light away.
<E>
<S>
In the coolness of the morning
Sparing moments here in magical tide
I would meet you without question
To share a starry gaze, a look through the sky

From the start, there was this kind of glow
The start, when its right, youll know

Fascinating loves a secret
An ancient riddle with no reason or rhyme
Unpredictable, the muses, they play
Never knowing whether teasing or shy

From the start, there was this kind of glow
The start, we're doing its right, youll know
<E>

Follow the typical signs, the hand-painted lines, down prairie roads.
Pass the lone church spire.
Pass the talking wire from where to who knows?
There's no way to divide the beauty of the sky from the wild western plains.
Where a man could drift, in legendary myth, by roaming over spaces.
The land was free and the price was right.

Dakota on the wall is a white-robed woman, broad yet maidenly.
Such power in her hand as she hails the wagon man's family.
I see Indians that crawl through this mural that recalls our history.

Who were the homestead wives?
Who were the gold rush brides?
Does anybody know?
Do their works survive their yellow fever lives in the pages they wrote?
The land was free, yet it cost their lives.

In miner's lust for gold.
A family's house was bought and sold, piece by piece.
A widow staked her claim on a dollar and his name, so painfully.
In letters mailed back home her Eastern sisters they would moan
as they would read accounts of madness, childbirth, loneliness and grief.

An August day in the hills of Spain,
A pair of children emerged from a cave.
The strangest sight there alone they stood,
With skin of green and words no one had heard.

The girl was stronger, the boy was weak,
With her new mother she learned to speak.
And wove a tale of a dying sun,
They left the darkness,
A dark world come undone.

They traveled so far.
Believing they came from a star.
She fell through life, through time,
(through parallel lives)

The men of science, the men of fame,
The men of letters tried to explain:
Was it parallel worlds or a twist of time
To make her think she'd fallen from the sky?

A whirlwind spun them all alone,
Took them from their twilight home.

Believing they came from a star
<E>
<S>
There was light
And atomic fission
Swelling wind and
Rising ash
Tide of black rain
Cement seared shadow traces
Reminiscent of their
Last commands

Instantly one thousand
Flames arising
Ill scent of
Burning hides surrounding
A settlement
Debased entirely

Enola Gay had made a casual delivery

Please build a future darling
With our bomb
Cherish and love it
For the sake of
Earth bound kingdom come

The undersides of
Fallen metal trusses
Evil debris of
Human bodies
Each window's glass
Shards pelted
Secure confines
Brittle collapse
Neighbors lay beside
Each other unknowing
Faces scorched
Of all familiar bearing
Too few hands
Wounds for closing
Marred by thirsting
Anguish
Fear
Lamenting

Here we stand
At the door to
Gold Atomic Age
Don't spoil your faces with worry
Trust in earth bound kingdom come

Ima tima ima tima

Totalitarian motions borrowed
Selling vantage points

I always knew that you would take yourself far from home
As soon as, as far as, you could go
By the quarter inch cut of your hair and the Army issue pay
For the past eight weeks I can tell where you've been

For I knew, I could see, it was all cut and dried to me
There was soldier's blue blood streaming inside your veins
There is a world outside of this room
And when you meet it promise me
You won't meet it with your gun

So now you are one of the brave few
It's awfully sad we need boys like you
I hope the day never comes
For here's your live round son
Stock and barrel, safety trigger, here's your gun

Well I knew, I could see, it was all cut and dried to me
There was soldiers blue blood streaming inside your veins
There is a world outside of this room
And when you meet it promise me
You won't meet it with your gun taking aim

For I don't mean to argue
They've made a decent boy of you
And I don't mean to spoil your homecoming
But baby brother you should expect me to

"Stock and barrel, safety trigger, here's your gun"
So now does your heart pitter pat, with a patriotic song
When you see the stripes of old glory waving?

Well I knew, I could see, it was all cut and dried to me
There was soldier's blue blood streaming inside your veins
There is a world outside of this room
And when you meet it promise me
You won't meet it with your gun taking aim

Well, I don't mean to argue, they've made a decent boy of you
And I don't mean to spoil your homecoming, my baby brother Jude
Oh, I don't mean to hurt you by saying this again
They're so good at making soldiers but they're not as good at making men

In the dark night a giant slumbered
Untouched for centuries
'Til awakened by a white man's cry
"This is the Eden I was to find"

There were lands to be charted
And to be claimed for a crown
When a hero was made by the length he could stay
In this dangerous land of hateful hate

Curiosity, filled the heads of these
There was an upper room, they had to see
Curiosity, killed the best of these
For a hero's hometown welcoming

Still they moved on and on and
Who came building missions?
Unswerving men of the cloth who gave their lives in numbers untold
So that black sheep entered the fold

Captured like human livestock, destined for slavery
Naked, walked to the shore where great ships moored
For the hell bound journeys
Bought and sold with a hateful hate

Curiosity, filled the breasts of these
With some strange ecstasy
Curiosity, killed the best of these
By robbing their lives of dignity

Still they moved on and on and
Calling men of adventure for a jungle bush safari
Come conquer the beast, his claws and teeth
See death in his eyes to know you're alive

European homesteads
Grew up in the colonies with civilized plans
For wild hinterlands, their guns and God willing
Such a hateful hate, such a hateful hate

Curiosity, spilled the blood of these
For their spotted skins and ivory
Curiosity, filled the heads of these
Madmen with the lies of destiny

Curiosity, spilled the blood of these
Then blotted their lives from history
Curiosity, filled the heads of these
One man claimed all that he could see

Curiosity, still entices these
Madmen with a lusting and a greed
Their legacy, legacy
<E>

To your common sense firm arguments
I won't listen to your voice of reason, trying to change my mind
I mind my feelings and not your words, didn't you notice
I'm so headstrong even when I know I'm wrong?

Take this to your heart and into your head now
Before you waste your time, call a truce and call a draw

What's the use in mapping your views out in orderly form
When it does nothing but confuse and anger me more?
I mind my feelings and not your words, didn't you notice
I'm so headstrong? You're talking to a deaf stone wall

Take this to your heart and into your head now
The old wives' tale is true, I'll repeat it
'All is fair in love and war', that's how the famous saying goes

Open up your eyes, see me for what I am
Cast in iron, I won't break and I won't bend

Take this to your heart and into your head now
The old wives' tale is true, I'll repeat it
'All is fair in love and war', that's how the famous saying goes

If I told you we were out to sea in a bottomless boat
You'd try anything to save us, you'd try anything to keep us afloat
And if we were living in a house afire, I don't believe
That you could rush out and escape it and not rescue me

Take this to your heart and into your head now
The old wives' tale is true, I'll repeat it
'All is fair in love and war', that's how the famous saying goes
Listen, I think they were talking to you

Hey Jack Kerouac, I think of your mother
and the tears she cried, she cried for none other
than her little boy lost in our little world that hated
and that dared to drag him down. Her little boy courageous
who chose his words from mouths of babes got lost in the wood.
Hip flask slinging madman, steaming cafe flirts,
they all spoke through you.

Hey Jack, now for the tricky part,
when you were the brightest star who were the shadows?
Of the San Francisco beat boys you were the favorite.
Now they sit and rattle their bones and think of their blood stoned days.
You chose your words from mouths of babes got lost in the wood.
The hip flask slinging madman, steaming cafe flirts,
nights in Chinatown howling at night.

Allen baby, why so jaded?
Have the boys all grown up and their beauty faded?
Billy, what a saint they've made you,
just like Mary down in Mexico on All Souls' Day.

You chose your words from mouths of babes got lost in the wood.
Cool junk booting madmen, street minded girls
in Harlem howling at night.
What a tear stained shock of the world,
you've gone away without saying goodbye.
<E>
<S>
I see the leaves of autumn changing falling turning what was green
I see a door standing open, open to curiosity we could be together tear
it all apart would you ever notice what was hidden in my heart
would you ever notice what was hidden in my heart,
as willows start to weep there as we stood upon the threshold
my deep heart is reeling forward and steady on to keep,
heartstrong do we ever listen closely
who said forever was for keeps?
who made me miss the last ferry?
who made this river so deep
<E>
<S>
My how you've grown I remember that phrase
From my childhood days too,"Just wait and see"
I remember those words and how they chided me
When patient was the hardest thing to be
Because we can't make up for the time that we've lost
I must let these memories provide
No little girl can stop her world to wait for me

I should have known
At your age, in a string of days, the year is gone
But in that space of time it takes so long

Because we can't make up
For the time that we've lost
I must let these memories provide
No little girl can stop her world to wait for me

Every time we say goodbye
You're frozen in my mind
As the child that you'll never will be
You never will be again

I'll never be
Be more to you than a stranger could be

Every time we say goodbye
You're frozen in my mind
As the child that you'll never will be
You'll never will be again

Every time we say goodbye
You're frozen in my mind
As the child that you'll never will be
Will be again
<E>
<S>
If you intend to live again
Open your eyes and don't pretend
You're feeling there's nothing worth believing

God, if you persist you'll die like this
And wither in the midst of your
First season, cut down with no reason
How can you be so near and not see everything?

If you intend to live again
Then take the outstreched hand
Of one who needs you
It's been so long, we've missed you

Why do you intend to speed your end?
Lie in the dark and let your limbs
Grow weaker, sinking low then deeper
How can you be so near and not see everything?

Feel what might be, see what I see
Again and again and again and again
Say you don't, again and again
And again and again, say you don't
You say you don't, but you will

Say, you say you don't but you will
You say you don't but you will

How can you be so near and not see?

It crawls on his back, won't ever let him be
Stares at the walls until the cinder blocks can breathe
His eyes have gone away, escaping over time
He rules a crowded nation inside his mind

He knows that night like his hand
He knows every move he made
Late shift, the bell that rang, a time card won't fade

10:05 his truck pulled home
10:05 he climbed his stair
About the time he was accused of being there

But I'm not the man
He goes free as I wait on the row for the man
To test the rope, he'll slip around my throat and silence me

On the day he was tried, no witness testified
Nothing but evidence, not hard to falsify
His own confession was a prosecutor's prize
Made up of fear, of rage and of outright lies

But I'm not the man
He goes free as the candle vigil glows
As they burn my clothes

As the crowd cries, "Hang him slow!"
And I feel my blood go cold, he goes free

Call out the K K K, they're wild after me
And with that frenzied look of half-demented zeal
They'd love to serve me up my final meal

Who'll read my final rite and hear my last appeal?
Who struck this devil's deal?
<E>
<S>
In the quiet morning
There was much despair
In the hours that followed
No one could repair

That poor girl
Tossed by the tides of misfortune
Barely here to tell her tale
Rolled in on a sea of disaster
Rolled out on a mainline rail

She once walked tight by my side
I'm sure she walked by you
Her striding steps could not deny
Torment from a child who knew

And in the quiet morning
There would be despair
And in the hour that followed
No one could repair

That poor girl
She cried out her song so loud
It was heard the whole world round
A symphony of violence
The great southwest unbound

In the quiet morning
There was much despair
In the hour that followed
No one could repair

That poor girl
Tossed by the tides of misfortune
Barely here to tell her tale
Rolled in on a sea of disaster
Rolled out on a mainline rail

To think of my task is chilling
To know I was carefully
Building the mask I was wearing
For two years, swearing I'd tear it off

I've sat in the dark explaining to myself
That I'm straining too hard for feelings
I ought to find easily
Called myself Jezebel, I don't believe

Before I say that the vows we made
Weigh like a stone in my heart
Family is family
Don't let this tear us apart

You lie there, an innocent baby
I feel like the thief
Who is raiding your home
Entering and breaking
And taking in every room

I know your feelings are tender
And that inside you the embers still glow
But I'm a shadow, I'm only a bed of blackened coal
Call myself Jezebel for wanting to leave

I'm not saying
I'm replacing love for some other word
To describe the sacred tie
Tthat bound me to you

I'm just saying
We've mistaken one for thousands of words
And for that mistake
I've caused you such pain
That I damn that word

I've no more ways to hide
That I'm a desolate and empty
Hollow place inside

I'm not saying
I'm replacing love for some other word
And to describe the sacred tie
That bound me to you

I'm not saying
Love's a plaything no, it's a powerful word
Inspired by strong desire
To bind myself to you.

oh,
How I wish that we never had tried
To be man and his wife?
To weave our lives into a
Blindfold over both our eyes
<E>

He fills the flower vases, trims the candle bases
Takes small change from the poor box, Tyler has the key
He takes nail and hammer to tack up the banner
Of felt scraps glued together reading, Jesus lives in me
Alone in the night he mocks the words of the preacher
God is feeling your every pain

Repair the Christmas stable, restore the plaster Angel
Her lips begin to crumble and her robes begin to peel
For Bible study in the church basement
Hear children Gospel citing, Matthew 17:15
Alone in the night he mocks the arms of the preacher
Raised to the ceiling tell God your pain

To him the world's defiled in lot he sees a likeness there
He swears this Sodom will burn down
Near Sacred Blood there's a dance hall
Where Tyler Glen saw a black girl and a white boy kissing shamelessly

Black hands on white shoulders
White hands on black shoulders
Dancing, and you know what's more

He's God's mad disciple, a righteous title for the Word he heard
He so misunderstood though simple minded a crippled man
To know this man is to fear this man to shake when, to shake when
To shake when he comes wasn't it God that let Puritans in Salem
Do what they did to the unfaithful

Boys at the Jubilee slowly sink into brown bag whiskey
Drinking and reeling on their feet
Girls at the Jubilee in low-cut dresses
Yield to the caresses and the man-handling

Black hands on white shoulders
White hands on black shoulders
Dancing, and you know what's more

Through the tall blades of grass he heads for the Jubilee
With a bucket in his right hand full of rags soaked in gasoline
He lifts the shingles in the dark and slips the rags there underneath
He strikes a matchstick on the box side and watches the rags ignite
He climbs the bell tower of the Sacred Blood to watch the flames
Rising higher toward the trees sirens wailing now toward the scene

On one morning
In the month of May
When all the birds
Were singing

I saw a lovely maiden stray
Across the fields at break of day
She softly sung her roundelay
The tide flows in

The tide flows out
Twice everyday returning
Her cheeks were red
Her eyes were brown

Her hair in ringlets haging down
Upon her face to hide the frown
Just as the tode was flowing
The tide flows in

The tide flows out
Twice everyday returning
A sailor's wife at home must bide
She halted heavily she sighed

"He parted from poor me, a bride
I'm widowed by the sea" she cried
Just as the tide was flowing
The tide flows in

The tide flows out
Twice everyday returning
<E>
<S>
Bent double like old beggars in sacks
Knock kneed and cursing or coughing like hags
Men marched on sleeping some without boots
Fatigue drunken deaf still to the hoots
Of breaking gas shells
Dropping softly behind
But limped on bloodshed
All went lame all went blind
Gas quick boys fumbling helmets in time
Someone still screaming a man in fire or lime
Under a grey cloud dim dark through green light
In all my dreaming before my helpless sight
He plunges at me
Choking guttering drowning
Put in a wagon he had to keep pace
As his eyes melt to his face
If you could hear blood
Gurgling from ruptured lungs
If you could witness
Vile sores on innocent tongues
You would not tell me
Not with such pride and such zest
The lies of history
Dulce et decorum est
Pro patria mori
Some desperate glory
Pro patria mori
As witness disturbs the story
Pro patria mori
Stand firm boys breathe the glory
<E>
<S>
[Chorus: ]
Everybody's wondering what and where they all came from
Everybody's worrying 'bout where they're gonna go when the whole thing's done
Nobody knows for certain, so it's all the same to me
Think I'll just let the mystery be

Some say once gone, you're gone forever
Some say they're gonna come back
Some say you rest in the arms of the Savior
if in sinful ways you lack
Some say that they're comin' back in a garden
Bunch of carrots and little sweet peas
Think I'll just let the mystery be

Some say they're going to place called "Glory"
And I ain't sayin' it ain't a fact
But I've heard that I'm on the road to purgatory
And I don't like the sound of that
I believe in love and I live my life accordingly
But I choose to let the mystery be
<E>
<S>
The color of the sky as far as I can see is gull gray
I lift my head from the pillow and then fall again
I get a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather
A quiver in my lip as if I might cry

And by the force of will my lungs are filled and so I breathe
Lately it seems this big bed is where I never leave
I get a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather
A quiver in my voice as I cry

"What a cold and rainy day
Where on earth is the sun hid away?"

I hear the sound of a noon bell chime, well I'm far behind
you put in 'bout half a day while here I lie
With a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather
A quiver in my lip as if I may cry

What a cold and rainy day
Where on earth is the sun hid away?

Do I need someone here to scold me?
Or do I need someone who'll grab and pull me out of?
Four poster, dull torpor pulling downward

For it's such a long time since my better days
I say my prayers nightly, this will pass away

The color of the sky is gray as I can see through the blinds
Lift my head from the pillow and then I fall again
I get a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather
A quiver in my lip as if I may cry

A cold and rainy day
Where on earth is the sun hid away?

A cold and rainy day
I shiver, quiver, and try to wake
<E>
<S>
Come as we go far away
From the noise of the street
Walk a path so narrow
To a place where we feel at ease

Some think it is haunting
To be drawn to the cemetery ground
As we
There's a stillness here
Thankful found

Child's pose angelic
A stone lamb at her feet
Part the matted overgrowth
To read the carven elegy

Some think it so haunting
To be drawn to the cemetery ground
As we
There's a stillness here
Thankful found

Born in New Albion
Of Rice family elite
Wed to Myron Bilowe
Thrice with sons
Blessed was she
Some think it so haunting
To be drawn to the cemetery ground
As we
God's acre is a fenced in
Hollow ground

Here soon to rise up
Amelia tender and sweet
Her last words spoke
All is well
All is peace

Some think it so haunting
To be drawn to the cemetery ground
As we
God's acre is a fenced in
Hollow ground

The sky was falling, heaven was calling.
When danger crashes, rose from the ashes.

Like two statues hidden inside ancient rock,
We were praying for the secrets to unlock.
And when the sun had turned its back on us,
In the dark our love kept track of us,
Pushed together by the lack of love.

We held each other tightly
through our hell of dreams.
I still hear the never-ending
echo of those screams.

But it's a life not made for reliving,
Its a life that makes your soul forgiving.
We sealed our bond from the beginning.

The legs of Maddox kitchen tables
My whole life twisted on a lathe
In a foreman's torrent
My first English was
"Faster boy if you want your pay"
Barking commands
Loud and simple
We could all obey

Then I was forever pulling silvers
Rubbed the sawdust always
Deeper in my eye
Varnish vapor that could linger
On my skin
It held tight
The whine of spinning blades
Still echoes to bother my sleep at night

See that ox
Stamped dead center
On the letter head of the company mail
Four decades a spitting image
Of the animal I portrayed
At Maddox Table a yoke was carved
For my neck

Sun through the window oil spattered
And in mason jars
Tricked plenty seeds thrive
The standing joke
Around the shop was
With my green thumb
Anything'd grow
My part was to laugh
Show and ornery jig had
Cut it at the knuckle bone

See that ox
Trade mark burned
Into every stick of furniture
From horn to tail
Four decades a spitting image
Of the animal I portrayed
At Maddox Table a yoke was carved
For my neck

Was tailor made

O my Dolly was a weak
Not a burdened girl
Treat her to a piece of vaudville
A Wintergarden moving picture show
Bemus Point on July Sundays
By trolley we'd go

To your benefit we's strike or bargain
With the waving fist a union man
Not just for
Smokes spirits candy and cologne
But for
Automobile keys
Cash in the bank
And the deed
On a place called home
<E>
<S>
I could feel at the time
There was no way of knowing
Fallen leaves in the night
Who can say where they're blowing
As free as the wind
And hopefully learning
Why the sea on the tide
Has no way of turning

More than this, there is nothing
More than this, tell me one thing
More than this, there is nothing

It was fun for a while
There was no way of knowing
Like dream in the night
Who can say where we're going
No care in the world
Maybe I'm learning
Why the sea on the tide
Has no way of turning

More than this, there is nothing
More than this, tell me one thing
More than this, there is nothing

She borders the pavement
Flanks avenues
The parades pass
White glove attended by

My mother the war

She'll raise a shaft
Lift a banner
Toss a rose

My mother the war

She knows every neighbor
Chats at their doors
Compare
Econosize electric appliances
Come share tea
And a seat by my
Cradle with

My mother the war

Forsaken vigil
Three years each tour
Hands of God enfold him
Prayed mother of the war
Haunt a doorway
Beg a postman
Is there word
For mother the war

5 black stars

In bitter defiance
She's spitting the corps
Wet a brood
Short league for combat

My mother the war

Well acquainted
With sorrow
With grief

My mother the war

Folded lace
Carrion and
Blood soaked robes
Folded lace
Carrion
Blood soaked
Shroud

Big big plans are being made
For my sisters Wedding Day
We'll have a ball at the sons of Roma Hall
Family, friends come one and all

First the best man makes a toast
To Rocky and my sister Rose
A life of years, free of tears
Bottoms up and lots of luck

Polka, tango everyone
Cha cha, mambo Rose and Rock alone
(Ahh)
Frankie Rizzo and his combo play on

Single girls all hear the call
Form a crowd at the back wall
And when the bouquet flies, each one tries
To be the best catch and next years bride

Uncle Sam and Uncle Joe
Take their places in the row
They're standing by, side to side
For dollar dances with the bride

Polka, tango everyone
Cha cha, mambo Rose and Rock alone
(Ahh)
He's a banker, she'll be well off now

Sister Rose take your mother's place
Trade your home and your maiden name
For list of vows and a veil of lace
Made a wife of you today, ho

Now they cut the five tier cake
That Colucci, he can bake
A frosted tower of sugar and flour
For the couple of the hour

Polka, tango everyone
Cha cha, mambo Rose and Rock alone
(Ahh)
She was born to wear that gown

Sister Rose take your mother's place
Trade your home and your maiden name
For list of vows and a veil of lace
Made a wife of you today
But you're my sister Rose the same

Honor salute and speak
To the corner standing flag
Do you remember how the days of school were
Indivisible separate worlds
Compare contrast
These dreams absurd
Placid classroom faces
Breathe in the features
Of a demographics death map trilogy
Children read them well
Not to bury three of four sons
As the likes of chivalry
Not to take six of thirty bills
To manufacture Corpus Christi
And so you think it can be so serene
History's most intolerable famine
Has clutched our global tranquility
Reaped the lives of children
Maladies collaborate
With cyclic despair
Infanticide clamors to twenty times more
In fourth and fifth worlds
The poor have always been
Beside us
Amid us
Death has always been
As million cease fifteen million that's an annual reap
Add divide multiply sum forty one thousand!

You must be leaving
You win a prize for that
For telling lies like that
So well that I believed it
And never felt cheated

You were the chosen one
The pure eyes of Noah's dove
Choir boys and angels
Stole your lips and your halo

In your reckless mind
You act as if you've got more lives
In your reckless eyes
You only have time and your love of danger
To it your no stranger

In that August breeze
Of those forgotten trees
Your time was set for leaving
Come a colder season

In your reckless mind
You act as if you've got more lives
In your reckless eyes
It's never too late for a chance to seize some
Final breath of freedom
Very, so very wise

Don't reveal it
I'm tired, tired of knowing
Where it is you're going

In your reckless mind
You act as if you've got more lives
In your reckless eyes
You only have time and your love of danger
To it you're no stranger

In your reckless mind
You act as if you've got more lives
In your reckless eyes
It's never too late for a chance to seize
Some final breath of freedom

Out through the foggy window there just to see the eyes of my future children
looking back at me back through the foggy window
on and on miles pass years turn over
on and on there from that rolled down window ponies run free
cradled protectively there in the greenery somewhere I keep this picture
on and on miles pass years turn over
on and on for all the roads we've travelled
and all the bridges burned I was thinking out loud the ways
of the world that all seem so constant how few
of the lessons we really have learned.
out through the foggy window frozen in frame capturing passing pictures
life's last refrain, memories ashes scatter
on and on miles pass years turn over
on and on

This was once a city
Harmony a common theme
But these complications
Now make life a bit uneasy

This was once a city
Hallowed buildings, scrape the sky
Voices ride the airwaves
Once a city years gone by

Will they still be standing
In the centuries ahead
Going underground

Little children hiding
Bullets never meant for them
Must there be such bloodshed in our hearts
Our homes, our heads?

Will I be walking, walking so free?

This was a city once

This was once a city
Harmony a common theme
But these complications
Once a city, once a dream

Lineage closed
Dissolved in its birth
Tragedy
Prelude a balance

Is a synergy of reason
Malicious hope
As techno atrocities
Lapse their effects

Associate these ends
Their clarity demands your revenge
Please compensate
And not deny

Jungle revenge
Infanticide
Crosses
Very thin walls

Latent casualties
Arrive from fatal initiation
No longer recessive
Genetic aliens abandoned
Plain deceit in the mirage of
A just one time cause

We, wed all changed the clocks
No ladies auxiliary to kiss
Their blistered cheeks
Gone

They were gone
[Incomprehensible]

But associate these ends
Their clarity demands your revenge
Please compensate

Now I've been happy lately, thinking about the good things to come
And I believe it could be, something good has begun

Oh I've been smiling lately, dreaming about the world as one
And I believe it could be, some day it's going to come

'Cause out on the edge of darkness, there rides a peace train
Oh peace train take this country, come take me home again

Now I've been smiling lately, thinking about the good things to come
And I believe it could be, something good has begun

Oh peace train sounding louder
Glide on the peace train oh ah ee ah oh ah
Come on now peace train
Yes, peace train holy roller
Everyone jump on the peace train oh ah ee ah oh ah
Come on now peace train

Get your bags together, go bring your good friends too
'Cause it's getting nearer, it soon will be with you

Now come and join the living, it's not so far from you
And it's getting nearer, soon it will all be true

Oh peace train sounding louder
Glide on the peace train oh ah ee ah oh ah
Come on now peace train, peace train

Now I've been crying lately, thinking about the world as it is
Why must we go on hating, why can't we live in bliss

'Cause out on the edge of darkness, there rides a peace train
Oh peace train take this country, come take me home again

Oh peace train sounding louder
Glide on the peace train oh ah ee ah oh ah
Come on now the peace train
Yes peace train holy roller

Everyone jump on the peace train oh ah ee ah oh ah
Come on, come on, come on
Yes come on peace train
Yes it's the peace train

Oh ah ee ah oh ah
Come on now peace train
Oh peace train

In the cruel garrison of affection
If worth of lore is true
You know the face of a temptress
Pit viper

A witch or enchantress
Pit viper

With the malign venom of conceit
She tries
Civil men
Conceal fear
Misgivings
When night entreats them
A greater chill sustains
Stains her
Darkness
Shall not inhibit death blow

Know this skin does not restrict her
Tear and shed the coil
Fall of garland leaves

Science is truth for life
Watch religion fall obsolete
Science Will be truth for life
Technology as nature

Science Truth for life

Man so near perfection

Possession

Secure no demurer

Defense against divine
Defense against his true Image

Destroyed with conclusion

Mercy, mercy, why didn't we hear it?
Mercy, mercy, why did we read it
Buried on the last page of our morning papers?

The plan was drafted, drafted in secret
Gunboats met the red tide
Driven to the rum trade for the army that they created
But the bullets were bought by us, it was dollars that paid them

Please forgive us, we don't know what was done
Please forgive us, we don't know what was done in our name

There'll be more trials like this in mercenary hey days
When they're so apt to wrap themselves up in the stripes and stars
And find that they are able to call themselves heroes
And to justify murder by their fighters for freedom

Please forgive us, we don't know what was done
Please forgive us, we didn't know
Could you ever forgive us? I don't know how you could

I know this is no consolation

Please forgive us, we don't know what was done
Please forgive us, we didn't know
Could you ever believe that we didn't know?
Please forgive us, we didn't know
I wouldn't blame you if you never could

Please forgive us, we didn't know
I wouldn't blame you if you never could
Please forgive us
And you never will

Tell me what's gone wrong?
I tilt my head there, under the faucet when I turn it on
Dry as paper, call the neighbors
Who's to blame for what's going on?
In the dark without a clue I'm just the same as you

Oh, they tell us there's poison here in the well
That someone's been a bit untidy and there's been a small spill
Not a lot, no, just a drop, there you are mistaken you know you are
I wonder just how long they knew our well was poisoned
But they let us just drink on

Oh, they tell us there's here poison in the well
That someone's been a bit untidy that there's been a small spill
And all that it amounts to is a tear in a salted sea
That someone's been a bit untidy they'll have it cleaned up in a week

But the week is over and now it's grown into years
Since, I was told that I should be calm, there's nothing to fear here
But, I drank that water for years, my wife and my children
So, tell me, where to now
If your fight for a bearable life can be fought and lost in your backyard?

Oh my dear friend
My dear friend Giorgio
How has this time Breton
Discouraged your liaison with the

Eye styled metaphysical
Incongruous scenarios
Dauntly jaunt about through nostalgic despair
Within childlike renderings

Of a nightmarish recall
"All my images Fragments
I've shored upon my ruins
Pictor classicus sum

I am pure"
Step solemn with the
Air of reluctant manes
As rod and hoop shadow children

Scatter through a henna arcade
Figures indentured to a windless landscape
Enduring silence and flame
Da Da da

No loyalty to the nonsensical
Scorned their nihilist pageantry

On bended knee
I've looked through every window then.
Touched the bottom,
The night a sleepless day instead;

A day when love came,
Came easy like what's lost now found.
Beneath a blinding light
That would surround.

We were without, in doubt,
(and now) we were about saving for a rainy day.

I crashed through mirrors,
I crashed through floors of laughter then.
In a blind scene,
No ties would moor us to this room.

A day when love came,
Came easy like what's lost now found.
And you would save me,
And I held you like you were my child.

If I were you, defiant you,
Alone upon a troubled way.
I would send my heart to you
To save it for a rainy day.
<E>

Power
Dizzy with it stumble
Detail
A chance for us to quarrel
Anger
My head is shaken violent

If I could calm or restrain you
For the sake of pity
Save the pistol
Save the cynics tongue
Save the cool white stare
And treat me to an honest face sometime

Amaze me now

Trust is
The greatest human error
Empty
Used me as a vessel
Ruthless
You're not known for subtlety

If I could calm or restrain you
For the sake of pity
Save the pistol
Save the cynic's tongue
Save the cool white stare
And treat me to an honest face sometime

Amaze me now

Artful
Well there's quite a skill to torture
Half smile
Was it all you could deliver
Token
So hard to be pleasant

If you could calm or restrain it
For the sake of pity
Save the pistol
Save the cynic's tongue
Save the cool white stare
And treat me to an honest face sometime

Amaze me now

Something was pulling me
Without knowing what was leading me on:
Your shining light.

In my darkest hour the only way
To bring the dawn was
Your shining light.

But you're unaware
Your shining light is even on.
Like with a little glance
When you take me by surprise
And I take a chance
And I see it all through your eyes.

Free me from my history
And show me where to draw the line,
By lighting up the mystery,
And you don't even know that it shines.

I'm not worried now
About flying too close to the sun.
Your shining light.

When December skies are cold,
You know I will always run to
Your shining light.

I won't abuse it
So please just let it glow behind your smile.
Let me use it,
Let me feel the warmth like a little child

Who understands your glance,
Though it takes me by surprise.
And I take a chance
And I see it all through your eyes
It's your shining light.

When the day ends and church bells are ringing
When the valley is shrouded in snow
When you're feeling that hope somewhere vanished
And there's no poetry left to console you

With the smallest step you'll find a way, oh of fate borne
And life is a jewel but stone will tarnish as dust will descend
Take a minute and wipe free the luster it'll mirror a day without end
With the smallest step you'll feel it starts a journey your way

Oh, they tried to tell me but I'll learn for myself
And when they tried to tell me you know the words disappeared
On the wind I was running away
And when the laughter echoes through you in a pale beaming ray
And you'll know always and ever within you anyway

With the smallest step you'll feel it
With the smallest step you'll hear it
With the smallest step you'll find a way
<E>

There like a feather you fell someones heaven above me
Floating so fickle tempting me teasing my ways
Thrown from its clutches I struggle to free what escapes me
Absalom hanging like you Im caught in between
Absalom hanging like you Im caught in between

Heaven then earth, heaven between you

Release me untangle my hair
Absalom hanging like you Im caught in between
Absalom hanging like you Im caught in between

Heaven then earth, heaven between you

That summer fields grew high with foxglove stalks and ivy.
Wild apple blossoms everywhere.
Emerald green like none I have seen apart from dreams that escape me.
There was no girl as warm as you.

How I've learned to please, to doubt myself in need,
you'll never, you'll never know.

The summer fields grow high.
We made garland crowns in hiding, pulled stems of flowers from my hair.
Blue in the stream like none I have seen apart from dreams that escape me.
There was no girl as bold as you.

How I've learned to please, to doubt myself in need,
you'll never, you'll never know.
You'll never know.

Violet serene like none I have set apart from dreams that escape me.
There was no girl as warm as you.

How I've learned to please, to doubt myself in need.
You'll never, you'll never know.
You'll never know.

That summer fields grow high.
We had wildflower fever.
We had to lay down where they grow.

How I've learned to hide, how I've locked inside, you'd be surprised if shown.
But you'll never, you'll never know.

God sent comfort

Becomes an inconvenience

Detroit to D.C. night train, Capitol, parts East.
Lone young man takes a seat.
And by the rhythm of the rails,
Reading all his mother's mail from a city boy in a jungle town postmarked Saigon.
He'll go live his mother's dream, join the slowest parade he'll ever see.
Her weight of sorrows carried long and carried far.
"Take these, Tommy, to The Wall."

Metro line to the Mall site with a tour of Japanese.
He's wandering and lost until a vet in worn fatigues takes him down to where they belong.
Near a soldier, an ex-Marine with a tattooed dagger and eagle trembling,
He bites his lip beside a widow breaking down.
She takes her Purple Heart, makes a fist, strikes The Wall.
All come to live a dream, to join the slowest parade they'll ever see.
Their weight of sorrows carried long and carried far, taken to The Wall.

It's 40 paces to the year that he was slain.
His hand's slipping down The Wall for it's slick with rain.
How would life have ever been the same if this wall had carved in it one less name?
But for Christ's sake, he's been dead over 20 years.
He leaves the letters asking, "Who caused my mother's tears, was it Washington or the Viet Cong?"
Slow deliberate steps are involved.
He takes them away from the black granite wall toward the other monuments so white and clean.

O, Potomac, what you've seen.
Abraham had his war too, but an honest war.
Or so it's taught in school.

Here is the store house of Her Majesty
Well guarded by sentry
But looks are free

Call this the rayless and benighted age
Witches by tallow candles shifted
Shifted their shapes
Here is the pestle and mortar
That ground the poison seed
A lute, a suit for jousting
And the poems of a balladeer
When all the Latin books were copied off
In golden script
Well hoarded away in
A monastery crypt

Superstition
Superstition beyond belief

Over mountain, over dune and over sea
Crude map and compass lead the caravan
And lead the fleet
Here's the loot and plunder
They bore home
Ivory tusk inlaid with precious stone
Raw silk and spices by the barrel load
A soft skin drum with mallets
Of human bone

A world wide rampage
Rampage of greed

So here the tour concludes
The Colonial Wing
The rooms of the most refined
Museum property
An early pair of spectacles
A claw footed divan
Ornate clocks with birds that strut
On the half hours and quarter hours

Hear them chime

Detroit, L.A., Boston, San Francisco
First time over the ocean on a plane
A billion stars below me lay, circle slowly JFK
So much there to see inside of a week

They came looking for something new
Try to press it flat inside of a few days

Old Dominion Saturday, Arlington's eternal flame
Sunday tour Niagara Falls in the mist
Monday I'll be heading south New Orleans the Cajun sound
Tuesday's Tupelo, Elvis's home

They came looking for something new
Try to press it flat inside of a few days
What a wonderful stay

On a mule, Grand Canyon ride on Wednesday
I hope to get to Denver in a day
Friday ride to Washington in the glacial mountain sun
Hop a train for Canada to the east

They came looking for something new
Try to press it flat inside of a few days
What a wonderful stay

Bent double like old beggars in sacks
Knock kneed and cursing or coughing like hags
Men marched on sleeping some without boots
Fatigue drunken deaf still to the hoots

Of breaking gas shells
Dropping softly behind
But limped on bloodshed
All went lame all went blind

Gas gas quick boys fumbling helmets in time
Someone still screaming a man in fire or lime
Under a gray cloud dim dark through green light
In all my dreaming before my helpless sight

He plunges at me
Choking guttering drowning
Put in a wagon he had to keep pace
As his eyes melt to his face

If you could hear blood
Gurgling from ruptured lungs
If you could witness
Vile sores on innocent tongues

You would not tell me
Not with such pride and such zest
The lies of history
Dulce et decorum est

Pro patria mori
Some desperate glory
Pro patria mori
As witness disturbs the story
Pro patria mori
Stand firm boys breathe the glory

Can I be unhappy?
Look at what I see: a beast in furs and crowned in luxury.
He's a wealthy man in the poorest land, a self-appointed king,
And there's no complaining while he's reigning.

The lambs are bare of fleece and cold; the lion has stolen that, I'm told.
There must be some creature mighty as you are.
The lambs go hungry (not fair), the biggest portion is the lion's share.
There must be some creature mighty as you are.

Can I be unhappy?
Listen and agree, no words can shame him or tame him.

The painted desert can wait till summer
We've played this game of 'just imagine' long enough, wait till summer
When I'm sure the rain has ended, the blooms have gone
Everyone killed by the morning frost
Is a cactus blooming there in every roadside stand
Where the big deal this cowboy gear sewn in Japan?

The painted desert can wait till summer
We've played this game of just imagine long enough, wait till summer
When I'm sure the rain has ended the blooms have gone
Everyone killed by the morning frost
Is a cactus blooming there upon the northern rim
Or in the ruins of the Hopi Mesa dens?

You met a new friend in the Canyon or so you wrote
On a blanket in the cooling sand you and your friend agreed
That the stars were so many there, they seemed to overlap

The painted desert can wait till summer
We've played this game of just imagine long enough, wait till summer
When I am sure the rain has ended, the blooms have gone
Everyone killed by the morning frost
Was a cactus blooming there as you watched the native boy?
In a flagstaff trailor court, you wrote the line
'He kicked a tumbleweed and his mother called him home
Where the Arizona moon met the Arizona sun'

Never before and never since

Will the whole world be warm as this
And as you feel it
You'll know it's true
That you are blessed and lucky
It's true that you
Are touched by something
That will grow in you, in you

These are days you'll remember
When May is rushing over you with desire
To be part of the miracles you see in every hour
You'll know it's true that you are blessed and lucky
It's true that you
Are touched by something
That will grow and bloom in you

I saw time turn so much there to unlearn,
You were envy you wouldn't say you tore heart strings
That sorry day dark light hid the tears one for each of the years
Love has reasons reason never knows
Time turns over love overflows I should have spoken sooner
On that sorry day your arms are open
And I wondered why
Wondered why
Five years passed to the day time heals some people say
When you hurt the ones I love you're also hurting me
And time turns over turning you from me I thought you'd never reach me
On that sorry day your arms were open wide and I wondered why

The still and silence is torn with violence
A loud breaking sound in the night is made
Hear it grow, hear it fade

The sound you're hearing, the sound you're fearing
Is the hate that parades up and down our streets
Coming within bounds and within reach

Now, inside the place we hide away
We hear it near and hope it turns away
Turn away

There's something seething in the air we're breathing
We learn slash and burn is the method to use
Set a flame, burn it new

We're overpowered
We kneel, we cower, we cover our heads
Feel the threat of blows that will come
And the damage that will be done in it's wake

Now, inside the place we hide away
We hear it near although it's miles away
We hear it near and hope it turns away
Turn away

This house divided, we live inside it
Hate's dwelling place is behind our door in fitful nights
Hear it walk the floor and hear it rave

As it moans and drags along it's ball and chain
As it moves through this house it can't escape

Now inside the place we hide away
We hear it near and hope it turns away
Turn away, turn away, turn away
Turn away, turn away

Those school girl days of telling tales
And biting nails are gone
But in my mind I know
They will still live on and on

But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy, but I'll try

If you wanted the sky
I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
To Sir, with love

The time has come for closing books
And long last looks must end
And as I leave I know
That I am leaving my best friend

A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong
That's a lot to learn, what
Can I give you in return?

If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a star
But I, would rather you let me give my heart
To Sir, with love

Trouble me, disturb me with all your cares and you worries.
Trouble me on the days when you feel spent.
Why let your shoulders bend underneath this burden when my back is sturdy and strong?
Trouble me.

Speak to me, don't mislead me, the calm I feel means a storm is swelling;
there's no telling where it starts or how it ends.
Speak to me, why are you building this thick brick wall to defend me when your silence is my greatest fear?
Why let your shoulders bend underneath this burden when my back is sturdy and strong?
Speak to me.

Let me have a look inside these eyes while I'm learning.
Please don't hide them just because of tears.
Let me send you off to sleep with a "There, there, now stop your turning and tossing."
Let me know where the hurt is and how to heal.

Spare me? Don't spare me anything troubling.
Trouble me, disturb me with all your cares and you worries.
Speak to me and let our words build a shelter from the storm.
Lastly, let me know what I can mend.
There's more, honestly, than my sweet friend, you can see.
Trust is what I'm offering if you trouble me.

The man in 119 takes his tea all alone
Mornings we all rise to wireless Verdi cries
I'm hearing opera through the door
The souls of men and women, impassioned all
Their voices climb and fall, battle trumpets call
I fill the bath and climb inside, singing

He will not touch their pastry
But every day they bring him more
Gold from the breakfast tray, I steal them all away
And then go, eat them on the shore

I draw a jackal-headed woman in the sand
Sing of a lover's fate sealed by jealous hate
And wash my hand in the sea with just three days more
I'd have just about learned the entire score to Aida

Holidays must end as you know
All is memory taken home with me
The opera, the stolen tea, the sand drawing
The verging sea all years ago

That young boy without a name I'd know his face
In this city the kid's my favorite
I've seen him I see him every day
Seen him run outside looking for a place to hide from his father
The kid half naked and said to myself "Oh, what's the matter here?"
I'm tired of the excuses everybody uses, he's their kid I stay out of it
But who gave you the right to do this?

We live on Morgan Street
Just ten feet between and his mother, I never see her
But her screams and cussing, I hear them every day
Threats like: "If you don't mind I will beat on your behind"
"Slap you, slap you silly"
Made me say, "Oh, what's the matter here?"
I'm tired of the excuses everybody uses, he's your kid, do as you see fit
But get this through that I don't approve of what you did to you own flesh and blood

"If you don't sit on this chair straight
I'll take this belt from around my waist and don't think that I won't use it!"

Answer me and take your time
What could be the awful crime he could do at such young an age?
If I'm the only witness to your madness offer me some words to balance out what I see and what I hear
All these cold and rude things that you do I suppose you do because he belongs to you
And instead of love, the feel of warmth you've given him these cuts and sores won't heal with time or age

Across the evening sky, all the birds are leavin'
But how can they know it's time for them to go?
Before the winter fire's, I will still be dreaming
I have no thought of time

For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?

Sad deserted shores, your fickle friends are leavin'
But then you know it's time for them to go
But I will still be here, I have no thought of leavin'
I do not count the time

For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?

And I am not alone while my love is near me
I know it will be so until it's time to go
So come, the storms of winter and then the birds in spring again
I have no fear of time

For who knows how my love grows?
And who knows where the time goes?

How did they teach you to be
Just a happy puppet dancing on a string?
How did you learn everything
That comes along with slavish funnery?

Tell me something, if the world is so insane
Is it making you sane again to
Let another man tug at the thread
That pulls up your nodding head?

How did they teach you to be
Just a happy puppet dancing on a string?
How do you manage to live inside
This tiny stage you can't leave?

Tell me something, if the world is so insane
Is it making you sane again to
Let another man tug at the thread
That pulls up your nodding head?

A dullard strung on the wire
When the master's gone you hang there
With your eyes and your limbs so lifeless

Tell me something, if the world is so insane
Is it making you sane again to
Let another man tug at the thread
That pulls up your nodding head?

How did they teach you to be
Just a happy puppet dancing on a string?
How do you manage to speak
Your mouth a frozen grin?

A dullard strung on the wire
When the master's gone you hang there
With your eyes and your limbs so lifeless

Tell me something, if the world is so insane
Is it making you sane again to
Let another man tug at the thread
That pulls up your empty wooden head?

Your hollow head, your marble eyes
Your wooden hands and your metal jaw pins
All wait in limbo for the man
Who knows how to move you this way

I'd like to know
What makes you stay
While your eyes still search for escape.

You think that I
Don't feel the cold (babe),
But I wait while confessions unfold.

You'll never make a living from reading minds
Or from getting your direction from exit signs.
Look into your heart
And you won't find me there.

You won't find
Me where you hide
And that makes us a matter of time.
Like trees exposed by fall,
Time reveals it all.

Tell me you want to do everything
But you're stuck up to your knees.
And I'm less likely pushed forward
By ambition than a breeze.

But there's a flame
That must be fanned,
And it appears as a beckoning hand.

Don't think cause you're not,
Talking you're being kind,
You've been getting there
Tolls your direction from exit signs.
Look into your heart
And you won find me there.

I take myself down in my own reckoning
It's beckoning me on
Still there's something wrong with me
I don't know
Could it be all the smoke?

(All the smoke x4)

Oh woe oh woe oh woe is me
I drown in my own ecstasy oh woe
Oh woe
Away, away, away with me
I'm unimportant
C'est la vie

Away, away

All these thoughts roam in my head
Will protect me from those snazzy beds
So instead of nights spent warm in dream
I scream I'm a demon of lust

I love you much too much
I love it much too much
I love it much too much
I love it much too much

Must be some demon of lust
Must be holding a grudge
Must be some gluttonous
(Watch your mouth)

I love it much too much

(This is how we love it x4)

Well I'm drawn in the smoke
And I'm starting to choke
As I pull on my coat
With this lighter I hold
Oh it's the flame that's delivering another fine dose
(Sweet sweet smoke)

Yes I'm drowning in smoke
(Sweet sweet smoke)
And I'm starting to choke
As I pull on my coat
(Sweet sweet smoke)
With this lighter I hold
Oh it's the flame that's delivering
(Sweet sweet smoke)
Another fine dose
Sweet sweet smoke

Ask me how I cope with this I say
I'm a lazy masochist I know

I love you much too much
I love it much too much
I love it much too much
I love it much too much

Must be some demon of lust
Must be holding a grudge
Must be some gluttonous
(Say that)

I love it much too much

This is how we love it (x4)

She was young
But she liked to act younger than she was
She was dumb
But she liked to act more dumb than she was
For such a young,dumb impetious thing
Says if she goes then she'll go smilling
And of course, she'll leave a beautiful corpse

The problem with you, the problem with this world (x3)
It's an ugly world and you're, you're an ugly girl

Hey

Give it, give it

She wants to be Grace Kelly
But she has no grace
She's always falling down on her pretty painted face
Well men call her pretty
Because she's pretty funny
She's always after the millionaire's money
But she don't care for anyone else but herself
She don't care for anyone else but herself

The problem with you, the problem with this world
It's and ugly world and you're an ugly girl (x2)
The problem with you's the problem with this world(x3)

FUNKY!

She's the highbrow girl in the low cut top
A society girl, she don't know how to stop

Well men call her pretty
Because she is pretty fun
She always makes sure to leave the top buttons undone

You're falling cuz you
Are falling cuz you
You're falling cuz you
You're falling yes you

Baby girl you walk so slow you
Got grass growin' at your heels
Baby girl
Baby girl when you walk so slow
It seems to me there's
No place you're
Headin' to
Me I'm on a train it hits the tracks and makes a sound
It goes
Clickity-clack
Clicki-tickity-clack
Clicki-tickity-clack
Clicki-tickity-clack
As I head quickly
In the wrong direction
(direction, direction)

All the stupid things I've ever done
I've never jumped from a train
Oh no
When you're in the air you just don't care
Nothing's in your mind
Then you hit the ground it makes a sound
Your body goes
Flippity-flop
Flippi-tippity-flop (x3)
Then you're down and you're
Stuck in place

Get down brother

Alright

Opened up my eyes and a blurry smile comes into view
(Clippity-clop x5)
Oh my God it's you
I feel a hand right up my thigh
The other grabs my shirt
(Clippity-clop x5)
Oh my God it worked
Then you take my wallet and you
Run away
Me my broken heart it makes a sound
It goes
Pitter-pitter-patt
Pitter-pitter-patt-patt (x3)

How could I have been
Such a silly fool?
<E>
<S>
You look so good
You look like jello
Oh me and you could get down
If it were yellow

Yellow jello
Me and you
We would make quite a pair
People would stare
And they'd dare to ask
'What's up with that?'

I said 'Jello'

Let's get some yellow jello 'n mellow
We could beat that fellow
Jello

You and me
We, we'd be so slippery
If we were covered in jello
Yellow jello

You and me
We look like quite a scene
When we walked about on the street
Covered in jello
Yellow jello

We could be red fellows
Covered in yellow jello
Just you and me
We wouldn't mellow
Watch the television
Yes officer some kind of show
Any kind of show you know

That makes us jello
That makes us yellow
Mellow some jello

You like jello pudding pops?
Well, I do too

That's pretty sweet

Well I'm drinking by myself
While everybody else
Sings songs down in the park
Brown paper bagging it after dark
But it's a plastic bag for me
Carrying my groceries
A few cans of champagne
Chose the high life for the rain

And the door man calls my name
Good old Joe sure knows my game
Though he says it's the youth to blame
I can't say I feel the same

See I'll be nursing number one
And too soon beer two is done
And then it's three, four, five, six
And they're all empty again

And still half the flask
I always forget I have
Sitting in in my office with my .38 special revolver

Still half the flask
I always forget I have
Sitting in in my office with my .38 special revolver (x3)

Looking back through another empty glass
To the past when I was so small
Peaking over the counter that was too tall
Stealing my first sip of alcohol
This could be my last slug of it all

There's still half the flask
I always forget I have
Sitting in my office with my .38 special revolver

Still half the flask
I always forget I have
Sitting in in my office with my .38 special revolver (x5)

If the dead haunt the places
Their bodies are found
Chamber me one last round to see
If my luck will keep
If my luck will keep
Oh yes chamber me
One last round to see
If my luck will keep this gun company

Drinking by myself
While everybody else
Is passed out in the park
Or going home in police cars
They sing

Oh la da da oh la la la (x12)

Oh yes she's gone to Arizona
With my money, with my money

But she's gone to Arizona
Took my money and left

Oh yes she's gone to Arizona
With my money, with my money
Yes she's gone to Arizona
With my money, with my money
And I got a gun
It's a black shiny gun
Yeah I got a gun
It's a black shiny gun
And I've been doing some thinking
Thinking it's a good thing she's gone so far
I feel Arizona rising
I see the devils on the run
I feel Arizona rising
Look out ladies here I come

All is fair in love and war
But this is business babe

Oh yeah she's gone to Arizona
With my money, with my money
Yeah she's gone to Arizona
With my money with my money
And I got a gun
It's a black shiny gun

Such a pretty little thing
Gave me a diamond ring
Such a pretty little thing
Ya get the mockingbirds to sing
Such a pretty little thing
I keep my shotgun shining
For such a pretty little thing
In the reflection smiling

Oh, her papa moved on
To the world beyond
Oh, yes a man can run
Into the setting sun
When the work is done
Black diamond
White gold
Black diamond

I want you so...
So closer (x4)

Such a dirty little mind
Take ya from behind
Just wrapping up those ears
And nothing good to hear

Oh boy, I tell you so
Devil man coming for your soul
He's got a big shiny car with wheels that roll
You straight down to the underground

Oh boy, I tell you so
Devil man coming for your soul
He's got a big shiny smile with teeth of gold
Teeth are meant for eating you

Sheep, sheep sleep
While the devil gnashes his teeth
Sheep, sheep sleep
While the devil eats

Devil man got a real nice grin
Shiny watch a shimmering
But ever from the moment that he lets you in
He'll be a drinking up on the blood of your sins

Old, so old
Is the story that you've been told
Old, so old
Is the story that you've been told

Give you all the money and the girls that you please
You'll spend eternity on your knees
He'll come and take you while your asleep
This thieving trickster is bastardly

Oh boy, I tell you so
Devil man coming for your soul
But you still gonna give those dice a roll
And hope to God that he takes you slow

Fool, you fool
He's got a hold on you
Fool, you fool
Devil's got a hold on you

Stars hang in the sky
But I can't close my eyes for even a blink
All those wicked thoughts are in my dreams
And it seems that I can't say I've been a good man
At the grocery store today
I went and I lost my mind
Screamin' at the top of my lungs
A grown man shoutin' at everyone
And it seems that I can't say I've been a good man

I've got a white sheet on my back
Pinned in place with a little tiny red hot tack
And it's a wonder I'm countin' sheep
When I spend my days acting so unrestly

And it seems that I can't say I've been a good man
And it seems that I can't say I've been a good man
And it seems that I can't say I've been a good man
And it seems that I can't say I've been a good man
No

'Cause I wasn't meant for the cities
I wasn't meant for buses and trains
So please forgive me if I'm acting strange
buh buh buh buh, buh buh buh buh
buh buh buh buh buh, buh buh buh buh
buh buh buh buh, buh buh buh buh

No more my darling
No more my darling
No more my darling
No more my darling

When the sun goes down
When the moon comes up
When the feeling's right
Even if you might come home tonight

No more my darling
No more my darling
No more my darling
No more my darling

Sword fight in the ballroom of my mind
So I wrote a sonnet on the wall
With just my eyes, I called it
Sword fight in the ballroom of my mind

If I had a hand in my own death
Will I simply tear apart my chest
And rip out my bleeding heart
Maybe death give me one
Of those fresh new starts

Wouldn't recommend drinking
When your love is gone (x4)

And so I hide beneath my bed
Invisible monsters after my head
What they want from me, I don't know
Better give it to them, so they will go...

Wouldn't recommend drinking
When your love is gone (x4)

I'll be drying in the bathtub
With a bottle for the pain
Drunk on whiskey
Watching my toes slip down the drain
Called a number on the TV
To see if I can be saved
But the man at the hotline
Sounds a little more depraved
When he says...
Oh he says!

Wouldn't recommend drinking
When your love is gone (x12)
(Invisible monsters after my head) (x4)

She's gone, she's gone for good
She's gone, she's gone
And is all so good...

Ever since you left me my clothes don't seem to fit
The beers are always empty
I've quit trying to quit smoking my cigarettes
Ever since you left
Ever since you walked out my door
The bills keep pilling up
It's not as if I can't afford the money
I have enough
I just given up and I don't care enough

All my family worried about me
Well all my friends they'd worried about me
What have I done for them to doubt me
It's not like I'm a junkie for your love
It's not like I'm a junkie for your love

Ever since you left me I won't pick up the phone
Every single time I do
Someone asks me if you're home
And I have to say no
They have to ask where did you go

The last time that I slept with you
Was the last time I slept
I lie awake with every other girl
Wondering if you wept
After you left
If only after you left

All my family worried about me
Well all my friends they'd worried about me
What have I done for them to doubt me

It's not like I'm a junkie for your love
It's not like I'm a junkie for your love
It's not like I'm a junkie for your love
It's not like I'm a junkie for your love.

Oh why am I the weird guy
Who always sits alone
Oh why do I care
No one calls on the goddamn phone

Well I've grown complacent
When no one knows I have feelings too
And I feel this way especially when I'm with you

You make me feel alone
You make me feel like a long distance phone call
You make me feel alone
Whenever I'm with you you make me feel alone

Well I could surely try to make you recognize
That these poor pleading eyes
Ain't asking that much
They're asking can I touch you

You make me feel alone, when I'm with you
You make me feel alone, when I'm with you
You make me feel alone, when I'm with you
You make me feel alone

Well even wallflowers need some water and some tender care
Well even wallflowers need some water and some tender care

Look, you little looker
As you loft about the town
You lucky little looker
You got us plain folks down
But I know about your soul
And I know where lost souls go

And I'll watch cause I'm a watcher
And us watchers we never be
But do tell me you healthy looker
Just how wonderful you've been
Cause I know about your soul
And I know where lost souls go

Our luck is gonna strike you down
Our luck is gonna strike you down

So die you healthy looker
And all us folks will gather round
And though you're so damn good looking
We're gonna stick you in the ground

And you'll go, Lord knows you'll go
To a place where lost souls go

Our luck is gonna strike you down
Our luck is gonna strike you down
Our luck is gonna strike you down
Our luck is gonna strike you down

Well, I'm shaky and I'm nervous and I'm anxious as hell
Manic, seeing static, in a panic as well
I'm gonna give myself a heart attack
But the doctor says you're much too young for that
I'm gonna give myself a heart attack
But the doctor says you're much too young

Oh my hero was much younger than I
When my hero was immortalized
On magnetic tape and digital sound waves
There's no grave for the soul
No vinyl coffin made of gold

You're made of gold (x7)

I never cared for the radio
They don't play him, they don't know
My hero lives on video, my hero lives on video
You can watch him move as he grooves by frame
In a mess of curls as the girls scream his name
(Spencer Bell!)

He was the lyricist, a mad scientist
An architect of quick wit
The best to smoke and drink with
The best to joke and think with
He was one of the lost
The first to be found
Keep playing his songs keep us comfort
To keep us proud
To have known this body
Whose soul is still so loud

My hero lives on video (x8)

Well I'm shaky and I'm nervous and I'm anxious as hell
Manic, seeing static, in a panic as well
I'm gonna give myself a heart attack
But the doctor says
You're much too young for that

One for your money
Two for your show
Three I've got your heart strings
Body and soul

Don't mind about the forethought
Cause no one really cares
And you'll see as it comes to light
As it does in life

These are modern times but the mind is all the same
These are modern times but mind me were not sane
We're so cruel

Print, print you little devil
Your feet been dipped in ink
But don't slip you little devil
Or you see us fall to pieces

Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

There's a story that we like to tell
Down in the back room we know so well
Southside of Austin
Where these blackout monkeys woke-up often
In a dirty saloon, yes
The room is a mess
Where the girls are over thirty and the boys overdressed
On the stage played a man they'd call Mr. Orson Brawl

And his band The Stool Pigeons
They got that bar room floor freaking
And now the floorboards are creaking
And the men wanna kill him
Because their women are peaking only when they call

Mr. Orson Brawl

Oh well
Yes he threw the false prophet down the wishing well
Oh well,oh well

From many we've come
And from many we went
But that's all done son
And you got her pregnant

Heaven laughing the day she was born

She'd say hey big daddy (hey big daddy)

You will reap what you have sown
You'll reap the seed of war
You'll reap the seed of hate
You'll reap the seed of love
You can't appreciate

You're poison, poison, poison oak
See how far down your roots have grown
Into the soil that God first toiled creating
The garden of Eden
And Adam and Eve
They had to leave
They had to eat from the poison tree

Oh oh oh, my tattered soles (x7)

Poison, poison, poison oak

And I pray
Oh I pray
Stand and pray the Lord
My soul to shake!

Suaviter et Fortiter

I hope to see you there
On the other side
Mary mother, child and lover
Only now do we discover
Yeah, we know what we do

Ah one ah two, ah hah hah hah!

The reaper inside of me
Creeping oh so quietly
A sleeper-cell in time of peace
Sitting on it's tendencies
For acting out so violently
A violet silent tide at sea
Then red October suddenly
Yeah free the beast

Free free free the beast
Let go the leash and watch it eat
Free free free the beast
Pound your feet give it a treat

Well it's the reaper inside of me
Writhing absent-mindedly
Masochistic fashion suits me nicely
Booze in the days and nightly
So unsightly, this side of me
Biting on it's bindings
I've been losing my teeth in all my dreams
I just need sweet release!

Free free free the beast
Let go the leash and watch it eat
Free free free the beast
Pound your feet give it a treat

Chewing my tongue for far too long
My jaw is starting to ache
I can taste my blood my face feels rough
Which is odd cause I just shaved

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

Free free free the beast
Let go the leash and watch it eat
Free free free the beast
Pound your feet give it a treat

Free free free the beast
Let go the leash and watch it eat
Free free free the beast
Pound your feet give it a treat

Well old Dan Tanengraph
You can keep your cold dead stare
Your pretty lady's waiting out
In the coal stained air
And I've watched your hair turn grey
Throughout the coarse of
One fateful day

And she got
Shy water in her eyes
And she got
Shy water in her eyes

Well on that creaky wooden porch
You can think about what you've lost
While some nurse you don't know
Brings you paper cups full of pills
Well your pretty lady's somewhere
Lonely and turning grey
Oh, what a mistake you have made

And she got
Shy water in her eyes
And she got
Shy water in her eyes

Well you can stick to your guns if you please
It don't bother me, oh no
You can stick to your guns if you need
And you need

Well if there's a moral here that's to be learned
It's not to let a good thing pass you by
Well right now you're staring straight ahead
Beside some girl with shy water in her eyes

And she got
Shy water in her eyes

You're a little too lazy for genius
You'd rather stay in bed
Rest your eyes
Rest your dreaming eyes
While I'm gone
Rest while I'm gone

You're a little too great for greatness
You couldn't help yourself
Sometimes the world
It gets the best of us all
And it's not your fault

You're a little too lazy for genius
You'd rather stay in bed
Turn in your sheets like a roasting pig
You're greedy, greedy

Could have been the one who saved the world
But you let the world save you instead
But I can't blame you I've done the same
I've done the same damn thing

I hope the pavement stops your

And why did you think, did you think
Tell me what were you thinking
And look, at this mess, at this mess
We're all so impressed
And slip, from this world, from this world
You'll be sincerely missed
But not by me
No not by me, no not by me
I don't mind, I don't mind

So drink to your death, to your death
We'll all be impressed
And smoke, till you die, till you die
I'll be there watching
And crash, your fucking car, your fucking car
I hope the pavement stops your

He bought a bullseye at the county fair
To show what a good shot he was
Cost him fourteen dollars and ninety five
It's on the wall, can you see,can you see,
Can you see, can you see it?

She caught a stuffed tiger full of styrofoam beads
Do you see how she carries with ease?
A safe smile wiped across her face
No fear for his fabric teeth

You're a plate, you're a plate
You're a messy paper plate
You're a plate, you're a plate
You're a messy paper, ah

He swings a silver hammer on a copper plate
Sending lights shooting straight in the air
A brassy bell rings out but I hear one sound as he shouts
I'm the winner, I'm the winner, I'm the winner, I'm the winner!

Stuck carny smiles with no teeth at all
Counting stacks of green paper bills
Next to those milk jugs that just wont fall
And a bursting money till

You're a plate, you're a plate
You're a messy paper plate
You're a plate, you're a plate
You're a messy paper, ah

I wish I was a monkey
I'd sleep in the trees
I'd do my best to imitate the man
Who does his best not to imitate me
You know I'd have thumbs just like a man
But none of the obligations
Yeah everything I'm tied to now would be gone,
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

I'd like to be a monkey, be monkeys with you
Cause I'm a monkey by myself with a lot of shit to do
I'd like to be a monkey, be monkeys with you
Cause I'm a monkey by myself

I'm in trouble with my family
I'm in trouble with the law
I'm in trouble financially
I guess you could say I get in trouble a lot
I've danced frantically in passion
I've lain motionless in apathy
But all I wanna do is swing in a tree away from the agony of
Love and sex and drugs (x3)
And all, and all of the lack there-ofs

I'd like to be a monkey, be monkeys with you
Cause I'm a monkey by myself with a lot of shit to do
I'd like to be a monkey, be monkeys with you
Cause I'm a monkey by myself

And if I was a monkey I'd be very, very funky
And abundance of bananas, monkey bitches and the skunky
Big red eyes and a big red ass
Chillin' in my monkey bungalow made of sticks and grass
The monkey life is the life for me
Not a pirate or MMC
MC spider monkey, the fly white hunky, the king of the jungle, the pimp in the palm trees
Dipping, sipping on coconut wine
Blinging out my rings
Busting out my rhymes
Cruising in my pint size Escalade
Smoking Philly Blunts in the shade

This monkey's got it made
This monkey's got it made
This monkey's got it made
This monkey's got it made

Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!
You turned your lover down
As though you just awoke
You follow the sound

Out the door to the ground floor
Where ya see a man standing
Where ya never seen before
Playing a guitar with his heart in a string
Watch him dance and sing out on the street
But everyone who sees
Just taken with the sight, not the sound...

(...Aa-aahh...!!!)

So let your hands slip off the wheel
As you begin to feel something
That could heal your broken shattered bones
As you drift off the road to turn up the radio
Your body is thrown to the unknown

Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!
You turned your lover down...
As though you just awoke
You follow the sound

To my guitar of which I sing
I will give my diamond ring
If only this old piece of wood
Would love me like a woman...

Ding Dong
Hello, it's Thwilla! Smooth like vanilla
Dancing you can't see me cause I'm on your record
Start snapping, start clapping
Moon walk on the floor till they call you Michael Jackson
Cause you're bad, you know it
Your dad he noticed
Slip me a love potion
I'll do the locomotion
Romba, Conga, Samba and Charleston
The sounds got me shaking in a major way
With a little help from Jim, Jack and James
Now, get in the middle miss, let me watch you wiggle it
Show me where you're ticklish and shake it like Shakira did
Done good without a doubt
Must of ate your Brussels sprouts
Now just please don't turn me down
Please don't turn me down
Please don't turn me down

Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!
You turned your lover down
As though you just awoke
You follow the sound

Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!
You turned your lover down
(My dancing shoes)
As though you just awoke
You follow the sound (x5)

Where did the time go?
Where did it go?
Where did the time go?
Where did it go, go, go, go?

(Old bag o' bones,all tied up with string)

I don't know...
Any-goddamn-thing!

(Ooo... ooo... ooo...)

We drink the morning
Like good ole' wine
We drink the evening
Because it's free! Moonshine!

Officer that's why
There are stars in our eyes!

(Ooo...ooo...ooo...)

Where did the time go?
Where did it go?
Where did the time go?
Where did it go, go, go, go?

Oh! Get a knife, cut it open
I wanna hear them sing!

You were always in control
You were never out of hand
You were so damn perfect
It was hard to understand
Oh why?

Well you always had a goal
And you always had a plan
And if you had the control
Then I'll never understand

Now you're talking like a man
Who's been walking the street
Blistered feet on, on that hot concrete
Singing songs, begging palms
For an alm or two

So I think you outta know
That I never held your hand
You were always in control
And I'll never understand

Mine is a wandering mind, is a wandering mind....

You were always in control
You were never out of hand
You were so damn perfect
It was hard to understand
Oh why?

( Ladies and gentlemen,
This is your captain speaking.
We have reached our
cruising altitude of 35,000 ft.
Stewardess will be moving through
the cabin with drinks and... oh!
Uh, that is... that's not good!
Ground control to flight 69. Your... wing is on fire!
What did he just say?
Dude, did he say the wing's on fire?)

Oh my God the wing's on fire!
Oh my God this sucker's gonna hit the ground!
We're going down
Aisle lights illuminate
Everybody screaming for their lives
I can't believe I'm gonna die tonight
Cause oh my God the wing's on fire!
Oh my God this sucker's gonna hit the ground!
We're going down
Oh my God the wing's on fire!
Oh my God this sucker's gonna hit the ground!
We're going down

Hey little waitress, lady please
Hand me a little liquor bottle
Anything to help me ease the pain of this crashing plane
Cause oh my God the wing's on fire!
Oh my God this sucker's gonna hit the ground!
We're going down

Captain's on the radio he says
For sure we've gotta go
So smoke 'em if you got 'em
If you got 'em go and smoke 'em now

She doesn't need money
She doesn't need diamonds
She's lookin' for pretty things
She doesn't want romance

She doesn't need finance
She's looking for rendezvous
But every time she's going down
She never looks around

I'll wait and watch her with my
Lens until she brings the curtain down
'There behind the keyhole'
With my fisheye

I'm back in the darkroom
I'm covered in fixer
I'm making a photograph
I'll send her some postcards

In glorious colour
I'm keeping the negatives
I'll form a letter from the news
With different type from different lines

I'll tell the world about her
I'll mail the People and the Times
'Oo it'll be so scandalous
For the both of them

But mainly her'
She showed them her husband
He ordered a dozen
He thought they were fabulous

The one with the --
The two of the --
And three of the --

He sold her to Hefner
Who put her in Playboy
He gave her a centre-fold
I made a real blunder

She made it in movies
I made her a superstar

When you open your eyes
To a brand new morning
And the sun shines
Above you

You pull on your breeches and say
Oh well
It's the start of a brand new day

For birds of prey
You live and learn your life away
But there below, your body must go
Against the grain

Like an old mule train
Keeps pulling hard against the
Here boy, there boy
The boss got you running everywhere boy

Ya got no money and ya got less sense
And you ain't going nowhere
But there below your body must go

For birds of prey
You live and learn your life away
But there below your body must go
Against the grain

Like an old mule train
Keeps pulling hard against the
Here boy, there boy
The boss got you running everywhere boy

Ya got no money and ya got less sense
And you ain't going nowhere'
But there below your body will go

At the end of the day
When you look around you
And the sun sets
Deep inside you

Dust off your breeches and say
'Oh well'
Say goodnight to the man in the moon
The sandman's on his way
<E>
<S>
Oo he's a sly one
He's a razamataz man
He flew in from Singapore
On a flying junk man
Oo he's a devil
Oo and the devil's gonna bring you down

Oo he's a stalwart
With a heavy load on
He's got a finger in everyone's pie
And he's got what you want
Oo he's a salesman
Oo and his goods are gonna bring you down

He's never got the stuff
If you ever come to him without money
He hasn't got the time
For the people who are down on their knees
But if the price is right
You won't be asking him where it came from

Oo he's a remnant
From the swingin' sixties
He pushed his load down the Kings Road
To the Chelsea Potter
Oo he's a snow job
Oo and his shovels gonna cover you

I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because
I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love, no no, it's because

I like to see you
But then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you
Don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us
I'm not in love, no no, it's because

I keep your picture
Upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there
So don't you ask me
To give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me
I'm not in love, no no, it's because

Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time
Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time

I'm dancing on the White House lawn
Sipping tea by the Taj Mahal at dawn
Hanging round the gardens of Babylon
Minnie Mouse has got it all sewn up
She gets more fan mail than the Pope
She takes the mickey out of all my phobias
Like signing cheques to ward off double pneumonia

Life is a minestrone
Served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold Lasagne
Suspended in deep freeze

I'm leaning on the Tower of Pisa
Had an eyeful of the tower in France
I'm hanging round the gardens of Madison

And the seat of learning
And the flush of success
Relieves a constipated mind
I'm like a gourmet in a skid row diner
A fitting menu for a dilettante

Life is a minestrone
Served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold Lasagne
Suspended in deep freeze
Love is a fire of flaming brandy
Upon a crepe suzette
Let's get this romance cooking, honey
But let us not forget

Life is a minestrone
Served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold Lasagne
Suspended in deep freeze
<E>
<S>
Co-starring you
And co-starring me
Starring us both together
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Forever and ever and ever
A back lot romance
A scripted affair
The screenplay a blessing from heaven
We're gone with the wind
On the Orient Express
To join the Magnificent Seven

The film of my love
Will travel the world
And travel the whole world over
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Over and over and over
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Over and over and over
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over

A close-up of yours
A long shot of mine
Superimposed together
I'll zoom in on you
With a love that is true
In cinema-scope forever

A clapper board kiss
There's an Oscar in this
A hit or a miss whatever
A box office wedding
A premier for two
We'll be on location forever

When Pathe recall
The thrill of it all
They'll edit us both together
A legend a classic
An epic of love
Captured on film forever
A lasting embrace
That time can't erase
Let them censor the wind
Or the weather
The film of my love
Will conquer the world
Forever and ever and ever

The film of my love
Will travel the world
And travel the whole world over
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Over and over and over
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Over and over and over
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over
Over and over and over

Another fish head in the dustbin
Another loser in the queue for the soup kitchen
Another reason for a visit
We think you'd better come down

Another nigger on the woodpile
Another honky on the dole
Another trip from off the 15th floor
The greatest story ever told
Was so wrong, so wrong

'Cause you promised milk and honey
With an everlasting life
And we listened with our ears closed
And a blindness in our eyes
But we heard them as they nailed you
And we saw you crucified

The second coming of the Holy Ghost
We need a pocketful of miracles
Two thousand years and he ain't shown yet
We kept his seat warm and the table set
The second sitting for the Last Supper

Another Guru in the money
Another mantra in the mail
An easy way from rags to riches
God's little acre's up for sale

The time is right for resurrection
We think you'd better come down
The church don't ring with hallelujahs
You haven't been for so long
So long, so long

Two thousand years and he ain't shown yet
We kept his seat warm and the table set
The second sitting for the Last Supper
<E>

I want to meet you at that restaurant
The one you love it's got a pretty front
What a front
The girls are holding hands
It's a treat to indulge
Or we can sit awhile and look around
Look around, round round
Look around, round round
This is the age of consent
You don't have to be coy
This is your own pleasure bent
We are here to enjoy everything
Everything that the traffic allows
We touch each other then we sip the wine
We smile and nod together, this is fine, it's so fine
Come on in the water's fine
We can jump right in
Or we can look around and bide our time
Look around, round round
Look around, round round
This is the age of consent
But you don't need to shout
This is your own pleasure bent
We are here to enjoy everything
I'm not holding you back Heaven's sake
Have you got to jump out of the cake
I don't want your endeavours to fail
But that pouch has got a sting in the tail
Sting in the tail
This little place has got me in a trance
We're getting closer but it's just a dance, just a dance
The band won't make a sound
We can warm it up
Or we can hold it back and look around
Look around, round round
Look around, round round
This is the age of consent
But you don't need to shout
This is your own pleasure bent
We are here to enjoy everything
Everything can be yours, but don't shout....

Bluebird take me on your wing
Teach me how to fly
Teach me how to sing
Bluebird, guardian of my soul
Inside everybody
Is a story to be told
I came in from the cold
When I found someone
Strong enough to bear
The strain of our existence
And troubles everywhere
But time heals
And I know you'll be there... ooh
Bluebird a symphony in flight
Symbol of the dawn
Symbol of the night
I'll try with all my might to be your brother
Always there for you
Mother (mother, mother) knowing what to do
And farther than anyone has flown
Courage to spread your wings alone
And who will help me?
Bluebird
Bluebird stranger to these shores
I look into your eyes
Have you been here before
Take me through the door to Heaven
And show me
The treasures that you keep
The magic of the sky
And the beauty of the deep
And I'll do what I have to do
To be one of the chosen few
Fly anywhere with...
You, Bluebird
Bluebird, Bluebird (Yeh)

Deep in the night
I can hear you calling my name
How can I try to help you woman
If you go on hiding your pain
Baby, Baby, the tears on your pillow are real
You can't go on pretending to me
when I see the pain that you feel
A code of silence, is a dreadful thing
It can make you feel harder
It can keep you hanging on a string
Here in the darkness
When I hear you calling my name
A code of silence is a deadly game
It's a deadly game (what's that you say)
It's a deadly game (speak to me now)
It's a deadly game (deadly game)
Lost in your dreams
Trouble on your face in the pale moonlight
Nowhere to run you've got to let me know
Where you are standing tonight
Baby Baby Baby
I know that you're hurting inside
Open your heart
I know that we can make it
If you talk to me now
A code of silence, is a deadly thing
It can make you feel harder
It can keep you hanging on a string
Here in the darkness
When I hear you calling my name
A code of silence is a deadly game
It's a deadly game (what's that you say)
It's a deadly game (speak to me now)
It's a deadly game (deadly game).....

It doesn't help you if you scream and shout
That isn't what this thing is all about
And do you really want to fight to win
You're missing out and that's another sin
Your dream of power is a sacrifice
Do you really want to pay that price
Just think about it and you'll change the pace
Look in the mirror tell me who do you face
Who is that?
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop
Nobody loves you if you moan all day
So take it easy then you'll get your way
You ain't no dummy and I'm sure you know
You know it's better if you let it go
You're in control if you let it go
You're feeling better when you let it flow
You never really had to catch the moon
You're better jumping to another tune
So let's jump
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop (do, do, do it)
I've got it all but it's not enough
I keep thinking "Boy I feel so rough
This can't be me, I'm such a happy guy"
I laugh a lot but I want to cry
A cry for help is just letting go
It hurts a lot but I think I know
It's time for change I don't need the hype
It's time for change and the time is ripe
So let's go
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop...

I watch her move up and down the beach, well
The fellows drool, but she's out of their reach, and
These are not a part of the scheme, but
Let them hope, and let them dream
So many dreams in the mind of the men, well
Come to life through a good one love
Margo walks in another place, well
It's in their minds, and it's on her face
Some like it cool
Some like it hot
Some give a little
Some give a lot
Some wanna give everything that they've got
Margo wants the mustard
Yeh, she needs a little spice
Margo wants the mustard
Then she'll spread it on her life life life
Margo wants the mustard
Yeh, she'll never ever stop
Margo wants the mustard
It will take her to the top
She's only got to smile that way when
It lifts your heart, throws your troubles away, and
When she moves, well I've got to say
This rhythm method goes a long, long way
It's in the bones, and it's in the head
This precious thing has got to be fed, well
I shouldn't say, but it must be said
It's even better when it's in your bed
Some like it cool
Some like it hot
Some give a little
Some give a lot
Some wanna give everything that they've got
Margo wants the mustard
Yeh, she needs a little spice
Margo wants the mustard
Then she'll spread it on real light
Margo wants the mustard
She'll never ever stop
Margo wants the mustard
It will take her to the top
(A wop bop a loo mop, a lop bom bom)
[classic ES solo]
I can't explain what she motivates, but
It's all around, but it's hard to relate
It must be close to heavenly bliss though
How I wish I could follow this and
Splashing out all over the place
Pour it all over the human race, yeh
I may be starting another sin, but
Sit right back, watch the fun begin
Some like it cool
Some like it hot
Some give a little
Some give a lot
Some wanna give everything that they've got
Margo wants the mustard
Yeh, she needs a little spice
Margo wants the mustard
Then she'll spread it on real light
Margo wants the mustard
Yeh, she'll never ever stop
Margo wants the mustard
It will take her to the top

You promised me a life
You promised me everything would change
Even said you'd be my wife
Ooh now you're gone

You told me I was handsome
Even told me I was smart
And I believed every word you said
Ooh then you broke my heart

I don't know why I was so hard of hearing
I only listened to what I wanted to
I couldn't see what was goin' on around me
You didn't need me
But I needed you
Ooh ooh

Now everything has changed
The tables have been turned on me
It's all been rearranged
Like the setting sun
Ooh now you're gone

I don't know why I was so hard of hearing
I only listened to what I wanted to
I couldn't see what was goin' on around me
You didn't need me
But I needed you
Ooh ooh

Now I'm sittin' in the dark place
I got murder on my mind
Say goodbye to the rat race
No more setting sun
'Cause soon I'll be gone

Thank you for the gift
The freedom to wonder
In search of the light
Are we gonna let it shine
Forgiveness is the key
The perfect emotion
Will you show us the way
To peace in our time
Where the wild wind blows
The deserts are shiftin'
And the seed will grow
In the sands of time
From the darkest night
A new day is dawning
It's a long long way
To peace in our time
Tell me where can we find
Peace in our - in our time
Where can we find
Peace in our time
From a distant shore
Voices are crying
Can you hear them call
Are we gonna light their way
Salvation is the key
We have to keep tryin'
What we need right now
Peace in our time
Tell me where can we find
Peace in our - in our time
Where can we find
Peace in our time
Thank you for the chance
To light up the darkness
Leading the way
Show us to the promised land
Tear down these walls
That keep us imprisoned
What we're prayin' for
Is peace in our time
Tell me where can we find
Peace in our - in our time
Where can we find
Peace in our time

On the street below these walls
Where I used to walk
Now I can barely crawl
All this darkness rising tall
Lord shine a light for me
I'm waiting to be called

I'm ready to go home
I'm ready to receive
Forgiveness for my sins
I'm ready to begin

Take this river to the sea
Where the Delta flows
The tide is washing over me
Guide this soul to Heaven's door
Show me where tomorrow lies
I'm waiting to be born

I'm ready to lay down
I'm ready now to sleep
A promise I must keep
I'm ready to go home

So tired I lay down
With these memories
Breathe shallow deep inside of me
If time has run its course with me
Then

I'm ready to go home
I'm ready to receive
Forgiveness for my sins
I'm ready to begin

When the evening shadows fall
When the time has come
I'll let defenses fall
To surrender's to survive
I will give up everything
To those I leave behind

I'm ready to go home
I'm ready to receive
Forgiveness for my sins
I'm ready to begin

I'm ready to lay down
I'm ready now to sleep
A promise I must keep
I'm ready to go home
Again

I found myself on my knees in prayer
The consequence of my deep despair
Now I must speak, get it off my chest
It ain't no joke and it ain't no jest
Every night she would come to me
But her demands brought disharmony
I said, "You can't bring your drums to bed,
Your rhythm method's gonna leave me dead."
Got to take this woman
Cos she's a whole lotta woman
Why don't you take this woman
Take this woman lock her away
It would be churlish of me to complain
But caviar every night is insane
I'm fit to burst, I'm not in the mood
But she say, "Lie down babe, I wanna talk to you."
Well I'm not fond of your family ties
The hangman's noose in your mother's eyes
You chatterbox like a talking head
Je ne comprends pas the words that you said
Take this woman
Cos she's a whole lotta woman
Why don't you take this woman
Take this woman lock her away
Don't want to love you
I really tried
But I'm hook line and sinkered deeply fried
I've got to admit that with all your faults
We touch and it feels like a million volts
Listen - I realised I'd made a big mistake
I'm only human for heaven's sake
Lord give me strength don't let me falter
I'm gonna take her to the alter
And I'll take this woman
Cos she's a whole lotta woman
I'm gonna take this woman
Take this woman lock her away
I'm gonna take this woman
Cos she's a whole lotta woman
I'm gonna take this woman
Take this woman lock her away
Woh, yeah....

See the monkey peel the onion
See the monkey cry
He can feel his tears are flowin'
But he don't know why

He continues peeling faster
'Til the onion is no more
Now at last his cryin's over
But all he had is gone
Whatever for

You and I are always chasing
Wild ambitions and far off dreams
As we run in all directions
Nothing's quite the joy it seems

If I tell you that I love you
Don't ask how much
And don't ask why
Have no doubt and ask no questions
Just believe it's not a lie

Never take my love for granted
But never put it to the test
Like the monkey and his onion
Too much investigation
You know the rest

You and I are always chasing
Wild ambitions and far off dreams
As we run in all directions
Nothing's quite the joy it seems

On that we could be contented
With the good things that we've gained
But in the end we're empty handed
Just because we need the world explained
<E>
<S>
Inside my loneliness and sorting through the mess
I came across a bunch of snaps and letters
I found an eight by ten, taken God knows when
It took me back to when we found each other
How did I let it start
If I could only remember
Oh, Oh, why did I break your heart
The tender parts we played
I thought we had it made
The recipe for life, the perfect fusion
But when the love turned sour
I found the happy hour
But drinking for the world is no solution
How did I let it start
If I could only remember
Oh, Oh, why did I break your heart
Can't we go back to the start
I needed someone to tell me
Why did I break your heart
The cost of loving is a heavy burden
Somebody's gotta take the strain
The things we said would make a cover story
But who's gonna say
Who should take all the blame
We analysed ourselves
It didn't really help
No one to referee, no rhyme no reason
I thought we had the best
But when you flew the nest
My heart decided it was open season
How did I let it start
If I could only remember
Oh, Oh, why did I break your heart
Can't we go back to the start
I needed someone to tell me
Oh, Oh, why did I break your heart
Why did I break your heart.....

Here on the street
Feeling the cool of the dawn
Shuffling feet
Faces are ragged and worn
They've been working all night
Waiting for the curtain to rise
While you're under the sheets
You with the stars in your eyes

Letter box noise
Snapping the day into life
Newspaper boys
Cutting the mist like a knife
We're beginning to rise
Curtain up the drama begins
It's the start of the race
All of us wanting to win

People rushing shouting pushing
Got no time for conversation
Inner city population
The struggle for communication
People trying pressure rising
Hook and hustle flex your muscle
It's all part of living
Do you want to get away

Restaurant smells
Mix in the heat of the day
Telephone bells
Kissogram girls on her way
Someone's thinking of you
Birthday boy is in for a treat
And the message is clear
Once a year life can be sweet

Caught in a flash
Cover girl freezes her smile
Media trash
Blinding the crowd with such style
It's a dazzling affair
A fantasy to star in your dreams
Do you want to believe
Everyone knows what they've seen

Twilight time in the city
And the shutters are down
That's when the singles are lost in their doubles
The happy hour comes round
To help you unwind in the shadows
Takes the tension away
It's been a hell of a day in the city
Now it's your time to play

Living under pressure
Do you want to buy a dream?

I say Phil can you get it he say
Alright alright alright
Tell me when can I get it he say
Tonight tonight tonight
I want money on delivery hey
That's right that's right that's right
I say baby don't you trust me he say
The city's a jungle where the strongest survive

Neonic heat
Flooding the darkness with light
The capitol beats
Feeding the pulse of the night
It's the music of life
Listen to the sound of the crowd
Where the rhythm's so strong
And the music is playing so loud

Where the rhythm's so strong
And the music is playing so

Let's stay a while and watch him
He's moving into action man
He's looking good but maybe
He's in the wrong direction man
But he wanna get a little, get a little
Every night, get a little, get a little
Something for his appetite
Everybody needs to have a recreation
Everybody needs a little comfort for the soul
You'll never make it in a motown suit
No way to fake it man they're not your roots
No, you'll never make it in a motown suit
You can't be a drummer without rhythm
Can't blow your horn if you ain't blue
Some folks they just ain't got it in `em
Tell me boy now does that sound like you
He's cruising with the singles
Down the margarita bar
He's boring to distraction
Pushing words and talking stars
(What's your sign)
He's gotta take a little, take a little
On the side, make a little, make a little
Something for his appetite
Everybody needs a little lubrication
Someone with imagination got to break the ice
You'll never make it in a motown suit
No way to fake it man they're not your roots
No, you'll never make it in a motown suit
You can't be a lover without rhythm
Don't blow your horn if you ain't true
No point in playing Valentino
He's a sham and brother so are you
You can't be a drummer without rhythm
Can't blow your horn if you ain't blue
Some folks they just ain't got it in `em
Tell me boy now does that sound like you

You had a dream and you make us swing
Doctor Winston J.F.K.
You had a dream but they blew you away
American panorama
Big apple rice banana
Bit but keep your backs against the wall
Pretzel logic does apply
Oh fast food junk food gets you by
You got delis diners southern fries
And burger queens with hungry eyes
That's American panorama
Aerobatic instant karma
Run but do your jogging in the car
Tricky didn't make it
But his part deserves an oscar
When he proved that you can fool the people
All the time
And from the Rockies to the Hudson
Everybody loves a winner
Turn a blind eye to corruption
While the nation grows
Oh oh I feel the pressure rising
You're on top of the world but it's about to blow
Do you know what you're doing?
Do you know?
Take a look at what you've done
You are the shape of things to come
It's science fiction coming true
You can shoot the stars it's up to you

Living in a TV drama
Turn it off and make the dream come true

I'll show you man who walk on fire
And don't get burned
Don't get burned, don't get burned
He don't get burned

I'll show you man who tread on glass
And he don't get cut
Don't get cut, don't get cut
He don't get cut

You can take a knife and slit his throat
And he won't drop dead
Won't drop dead, won't drop dead
He won't drop dead

Been a ju-ju boy for a thousand years
And he ain't cut yet
Ain't cut yet, ain't cut yet
He ain't cut yet

Hold 'em
You've got to crease 'em and fold 'em
You've got to shape 'em and mould 'em
Take a piece of their soul man

Well he can take a little moonlight
Suck the poison from a snakebite
Movin' round about midnight
He's got the power of life

See the sacrifice of the virgin women
See the deadly snake and the headless chicken
Take a sip from dripping red
Make it with the living dead

Take you up when you feeling down
When you're sick he will come around
Takes his cures from out the ground
He's the one who can hypnotize
And you'll never believe your eyes
He can cause the dead to rise
<E>
<S>
a shake of the tin
the money drops in, but is it a sin
you're standing in rags
you're selling your flags
but who gets the dough at the end of the day
we saw your drop-dead fancy wheels
your little house up on the hill
but when your conscience pricks
a little sacrifice sweetens the pill
so keep your hands in your pockets
charity begins at home
keep your hands in your pockets
charity won't leave you alone
we take to the stage
the audience rave, we're doing our bit
a heavenly cast, a blast from the past
there's a song to be sung, will it make number one
we wanna see your money roll
but our eyes are on the hall of fame
`cos business is business
and hits are the name of the game
so keep your hands in your pockets
charity begins at home
keep your hands in your pockets
charity won't leave you alone
everywhere that we turn
there are mouths to be fed
how can we sleep
the battle goes on while we're
safe in our beds
so don't turn away
no don't turn away
your doors are locked
you switch on the box to take in a show
you think that you're safe
but here comes that face
and wouldn't you know it's that message again
they want to take your plastic cash
your hand reaches out to the phone
keep your hands in your pockets
charity begins at home
keep your hands in your pockets
charity begins at home
keep your hands in your pockets
charity won't leave you alone
everywhere that we turn
there are mouths to be fed
how can we sleep
the battle goes on while we're
safe in our beds
so don't turn away
no don't turn away
keep your hands in your pockets
charity begins at home
keep your hands in your pockets
charity won't leave you alone

Oh oh I feel the city rhythm
Oh oh I love those city lights
But when the sun comes up
And the party's over
I don't care I'm coming back tonight
To the bright city lights

Home from work got your money in your pocket
Pull on your boots brand new suit
If you had the chance you'd hock it
For a night on the tiles

And a shot of midnight fever
Get off your back get on the track
Tune in your receiver oh oh

Oh oh I feel the city rhythm
Oh oh I love those city lights
But when the sun comes up
And the party's over
I don't care I'm coming back tonight
To the bright city lights

Truck down the street feeling kinda funky
Get on the beat shuffle your feet
Never know you might get lucky
You got love on the brain

Flashing like a neon
Feed 'em a line
Give 'em a sign
They're looking for a come on oh oh

Oh oh I feel the city rhythm
Oh oh I love those city lights
But when the sun comes up
And the party's over
I don't care I'm coming back tonight
To the bright city lights

No way to stop when the music's in your body
Into the night feel all right
No time for feeling sorry
You go down to the club
With the old familiar faces
Buy 'em a drink kick up a stink
Everybody's going crazy oh oh

Oh oh I feel the city rhythm
Oh oh I love those city lights
But when the sun comes up
And the party's over
I don't care I'm coming back tonight
To the bright city lights

To the bright city lights
To the bright city lights
To the bright city lights
Oh I love those city lights

"I'm a clockwork creep
And I can't get to sleep
They wind me up and let me go
And I can't unwind
Going out of my mind
My time is coming soon you know"
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
"I'm a jumbo jet
With a brand new set
Of passengers and bags and crew
I'll spread my wings -
Do a thousand things
To prove how good I am to you"
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Meanwhile in the cargo of escargot
The temperature is rising
Advertising that our time is running
Down, down, down, down, down
Oh with just one minute to live
Oh, no you'll never get me up in one of these again
`Cos what goes up must come
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Oh, the gravity of the situation
It's only my willpower
That keeps this thing in operation
But we're gonna crash that's for certain
The pilot is too busy flirtin'
And he ain't aware
That there's a bomb down there
And if he don't do something it's curtains
"Now just hold on,"
Said the little bomb,
"If you were just to hold my hands
Then time would stop
The plot would flop
And jumbo would be safe to land"
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
My landings are the envy
Of Sabena and Pan Am
From Chattanooga to Japan
I taxi through the airways -
What a swell little plane
What a fine little plane
What a great little plane
I am
"Hang on one sec
I'm a clockwork wreck
And though my fuse is burning slow
Must keep my date to detonate
Goodbye, ta ta, and cheerio
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a........."

I was walkin' down the street
Concentratin' on truckin' right
I heard a dark voice beside of me
And I looked round in a state of fright
I saw four faces one mad
A brother from the gutter
They looked me up and down a bit
And turned to each other

I say
I don't like cricket oh no
I love it
I don't like cricket no no
I love it
Don't you walk thru' my words
you got to show me some respect
Don't you walk thru' my words
'Cause you ain't heard me out yet.

Well he looked down at my silver chain
He said I'll give you one dollar
I said you#ve got to be jokin' man
It was a present from me mother
He said I like it I want it
I'll take it off your hands
And you'll be sorry you crossed me
You'd better understand that you're alone
A long way from home.

And I say
I don't like reggae no no
I love it
I don't like reggae
I love it
Don't you cramp my style
Don't you queer me pitch
Don't you walk thru' my words
'Cause you ain't heard me out yet.

I hurried back to the swimming pool
Sinkin' Pena Calarda
I heard a dark voice beside me say
Would you like something harder
She said I've got it you want it
My harvest is the best
And if you try it you'll like it
And whollow in a Dreadlock Holiday.

And I say
Don't like Jamaica oh no
I love her
Don't like Jamaica oh no
I love her oh yea
Don't you walk thru' her words
You got to show some respect
Don't you walk thru' her words
'Cause you ain't heard her out yet.

I don't like cricket
I love it Dreadlock Holiday
I don't like reggae
I love it Dreadlock Holiday
Don't like Jamaica
I love her Dreadlock Holiday.

You ask me what's it like now
I've got no woman - don't ask
You ask me how's it feel to be alone
You've got no one - don't ask
I'll tell you what's the story
Who's the judge and who's the jury - the past
Don't ask me what it's like to be alone at night
I hear a tapping on the wall
(I hear you knocking but ya)
I calm myself by leaving on the bathroom light
I know there's no one out there
But that don't really help at all
So tell me what's it like now
You got nobody - don't ask
Who looks after your health
I do it myself
How do you survive
I'm staying alive
Who looks after your home
I do it on my own
And how do you sleep
I sleep alone
Nobody told me that I had to live this way
Yea I could really have a ball
(you keep a knocking but ya)
But if I can't have you I'd rather stay this way
And live in hope that maybe
One day you'll take the time to call
So tell me what's it like now
You've got no woman - don't ask
Who looks after your health
I do it myself
How do you survive
I'm staying alive
Who looks after your home
I do it on my own
And how do you sleep
I sleep alone
I'll tell you what it's like now
I got no woman - don't ask
<E>
<S>
you know i cannot always be there with you
when something crazy takes me far away
we must stick together through this madness
i've got so many things I want to say
too many forces try to come between us
so little time to share and talk to you
if i show my hand to you in panic
please remember what i'm going through
i've loved you forever
but it seems like a day
and i want to be there with you
i didn't want it this way
don't think i don't trust in you
i just needed to say
don't break the promises
that we made today, oh no
don't break the promises
do you remember counting every moment
before the world we knew was torn apart
now when i close my eyes i can be with you
but are we really dancing in the dark
a bad connection leads us to confusion
we're all too easily misunderstood
oh we've been together through these nightmares
and now we've got a chance to make it good
i've loved you forever
but it seems like a day
and i want to be there with you
i didn't want it this way
don't think i don't trust in you
i just needed to say
don't break the promises
that we made today, oh no
don't break the promises
that we made today
don't you break the promises
(don't break the promises, promises)
if you do you'll be breaking my heart
(don't break the promises that you made)
oh don't forget the things we said
(promises, promises)
at the start oh no
i've loved you forever
but it seems like a day
and i want to be there with you
i didn't want it this way
don't think i don't trust in you
i just needed to say
don't break the promises
that we made today, oh no
don't break the promises
that we made today
don't break the promises
that we made today

Hello there
How have you been
I've called a million times
But to me you're never in
I know I never had the style
or dash of Errol Flynn
But I loved you

I'm doing really well
I'm as happy as a lark
I got a new apartment
It's as safe as Central Park
And if they ever mug me
When I'm walking in the dark
Will you know

Don't hang up
Don't hang up

Rolled up in my camera
With the big cheese up above
I stumbled from my stag night
To a never ending limousine

The band went la di da di da
And I got loady do di dodied
Lousy violins began to play
I went no no no
And as the vol-au-vents exploded
I was walking down the aisle the other way

Don't hang up
Don't hang up
Don't say, oh
Nobody's safe in our house

Leave me alone
But a but a please
Leave me alone
Just a mo, a minute
I'm so alone

We had
Some honeymoon on itchy bedding
Scum buzzing round your busy body
Dumb waiters waiting sweating straining
All mass-debating my woman

We got a
Bum Guatemala pensione
Crumbling about our ears, Ole
Even the trash man he say

You got a dustbin romance
It's going down the drain
You got a low impedance
She's got a rocky terrain

Oh, you got a lot to learn
Oh, you got a lot to learn
You got a lot to learn about women
A lot to learn about women women
What's to learn about women
We've both got a lot to learn

Surprise surprise
There's a hell of a well in your eyes
Have we won the no Nobel Prize
Has the color run out of our dyes

Surprise surprise
There's a hell of a well in your eyes
When the barman said "What're you drinking?"
I said marriage on the rocks

I know I never had the style
or dash of Errol Flynn
But I loved you

Don't hang up
Don't hang up
Don't say
<E>

We came across from Korea
We braved the wind and the rain
We came a thousand miles just to be here
And you want to send we back again

We crossed Malaysian waters
We sailed the South China Sea
We stopped at Singapore and Jakarta
And you want to send we back to sea

Don't send we back, have mercy upon us
We know you don't want us but we've got no one
Don't send we back, we've run out of water
We won't last the morning in the baking sun

The Indonesian Islands
We stopped at every one
As for the Philippines we tried 'em
And you want to turn our boat around
<E>
<S>
You and I don't have to hurry
Take your time now don't you worry
Let me know what you're going through
There's a troubled look on your face
And it would only take the time
it takes, for me to talk to you
And now and then we've got to question
Am I right, I may be wrong
And the only way we can work it out
We've got to try to give and take
And it will only take the time
it takes for me to talk to you
But don't turn me away
Open up your eyes now
Making up will only take a minute
Don't turn me away
Listen what your heart say
Making up will only take a minute
Breaking up is hard to turn around
You can't be living in emptiness
You've been lonely too long
But don't go making me promises
When you know that you're wrong
You're not true
So when you find out where your heart is
Let me know
I'll be waiting for you
You and I don't have to hurry
Take your time now don't you worry
Let me know what you're going through
There's a troubled look on your face
And it would only take the time
it takes, for me to talk to you
But don't turn me away
Open up your eyes now
Making up will only take a minute
Don't turn me away
Listen what your heart say
Making up will only take a minute
But you know, well you know

Put your money where your mouth is
Get your finger on the buzzer
Paint it on
Show the bumps
'Cause you're really gonna jump tonight

Can you fell you're getting ready?
Don't you see it in the mirror?
Show it all
Show too much
Hey, you're really gonna jump tonight

Drink in all that funky stuff
Take it till you've had enough

Put your image in your pocket
Hang your collar in the closet
Cause a crash
Make a splash

'Cause you're really gonna wipe 'em out
Getting rid of inhibitions
Makes a little exhibition
Turn it on
Lossen up
'Cause you're really gonna wipe 'em out

Dressed to kill, she want to play with you
Watch your step, she's gonna run you through
Dressed to kill, she's got amazing grace
Watch the Devil, with an angel's face
Drink in all that funky stuff
Take it till you've had enough

So you're lookin' like a million
And you're getting the attention
Play 'em up
Turn 'em on

Boy they're really gonna work tonight
Hey he's sittin' in the corner
Like a little Jack Horner
Make him break

Take his cake
Oh he's gonna be your fool tonight
Catch him with that funky stuff
Take him till you've had enough

I took my fantasy to Deborah
You know she's always been a friendly girl
You'll see her cruise the Picadilly streets
And she winks at every man she meets
I've been a fan of hers for quite a time
I tried to pull her with a bummer line
I asked her would she like a cigarette
And she said let's go to bed
(`cause that's what you want)
And so I went
And I was shocked
I was so green
Ground I wish you'd swallow me up
She had to laugh
I nearly died
Some Superstud!
There's more to this than meets the eye
I hurried back to read the manual through
You know the one that tells you what to do
But all I needed was the confidence
To start and break the ice
Experience would be a boon for life
And Debbie smiled as I came strolling by
I said I'd like to have a second shot
And I'd give it all I've got
And with a twinkle in her eye
She led me by the hand
Through a door to a room
Above a Soho restaurant
And she smiled and told me
Not to look so serious
But by the time she'd talked me down
I was delerious, I was away
I had to window shop in Amsterdam
But down the Troubador in Hollywood
I found a lover who was bold enough
To live my fantasy (this isn't a dream)
I was away
Up in the blue
Emmanuelle
How you gonna make it in a jet
The need to shock
Was coming through
Where would it end
You'll never know
<E>
<S>
You went out on the street without your shoes on
You didn't listen what your momma said
She said you won't feel the benefit, won't feel the benefit
And if we all went out without our shoes on
Tell me where would we be, where would we be

If all the people in the world lost their reason
What would we see, where would we be
If all the entertainers in the world lost their music
What would they play, what could they say
To pacify the crowd, to justify themselves
Won't feel the benefit

You're like a cloud behind the sun
Like the face behind the clown
You're moving like the wrinkles in a frown
And you can never look back

A leaf that's borne upon the wind
A cardboard suitcase in your hand
The wanderer soon returns
And finds the colour of the grass is just the same
On the other side of the tracks, oh no

Ooh when you smile it's like a holiday
Ooh pack your bags and we can get away
We'll float on a Queen down to Rio
There's no need to shave
We'll be stinking like rum in a punch

You can walk on the water
You can dabble in the mumbo jumbo
You can smoke a little ganja
Float like a cloud over Rio, Rio

You can ride with the Gauchos
Swinging your bolas in a red bandana
You can run with the devil
Takin' your chances with Senorita

You can drink a lot of coffee in Brazil
But the bill is gonna make you ill

Feel the benefit

So, you can go out on the street and take your chances
But if you do, you better do it right
Or you won't feel the benefit, won't feel the benefit
Spin the wheel and take your chances
And your number might come up
Though the odds may be in favor of the house

If all the people in the world would say together
We're all black and white, we're all day and night
If all the people in the world could sing together
How would it sound, what would we feel

We'd all feel the benefit
<E>
<S>
I saw you so pretty
Your face lit up the city
Two worlds came together
The memory stays for evermore
So different your fashion
You were the main attraction
Heads turning in wonder
I felt myself go under
(Oomachasaooma...)
'Ooh I'm a drowning man
Save me please
I need you so give me a helping hand
[CHORUS]
Nothing can stop you when you
Feel the love
No chains can hold you when you
Feel the love
Don't try to fight it when you
Feel the love
Nobody matters but the one you love
My intro I fumble
My facade starts to crumble
So strange your reaction
I made the right connection now
You got me no bother
I can't see any other
The world keeps on turning
I wouldn't care if it was burning
(Oomachasaooma...)
'Ooh I'm a drowning man
Save me please
I need you so give me a helping hand
[CHORUS]
It's a million to one
You should find the right door
But there's no guarantee
You'll find what you're looking for
Don't give up if you blow it the first time around
But you've got to beware
If you're walking on air
Keep your feet on the ground
(Keep your feet on the ground)
Don't stop me I'm not dreaming
I can't ignore this feeling
Your love is my lifeline
You're so right so fine so glad you're mine
(Oomachasaooma...)
'Ooh I'm a drowning man
Save me please
I need you so give me a helping hand
[CHORUS (Repeat to fade)]

my baby told me she would meet me on the street
stood behind a lamppost, I could only see her feet
now I'm not one to grumble, don't want to be a bore
but that silly bitch Jane Fonda's got a lot to answer for
told the women of the world that the only way to win
work out `til you burn out and you'll get super slim
i rushed her to the restaurant and called the maitre d', oh help me
fill her up, fill her up
load up, load up
fill her to the top
fill her up, fill her up
keep it coming, keep it coming
never let it stop
we staggered from the restaurant feeling in the pink
i slipped into the liquor store and gave the man a wink
my baby got the shivers, said you've got to stop and think
what you're doing to your body with this evil demon drink
said the poison that you're buying gonna eat away your brain
i said you'd better listen up before you go insane
knocked her off her soapbox, rushed her to the bar, and shouted
fill her up, fill her up
down `em, drown `em
fill her to the top
fill her up, fill her up
keep `em coming, keep `em coming
never let them stop
that's right, one more
tequilla sunrise with a little umbrella on it
okay, encore
a bloody mary with a little shot of bourbon on the side
too many moaning minnies
they're out to spoil our fun
watch out for sister anna
she's the one who bangs the drum
bang the drum
now you may think i'm worried by the screwballs that i meet
just to prove i'm not i'll throw a party in the street
everyone's invited, but you've got to take the pledge
leave behind your scruples, let me take you to the edge
everything in moderation that's the golden rule
take away all pleasure, that seems kind of cruel
to give the people power got to give them fuel, so i say
fill em up, fill em up
lead em, feed em
fill em to the top
fill em up, fill em up
everybody, everybody
never let it stop
fill em up, fill em up
lead em, feed em
fill em to the top
fill em up, fill em up
everybody, everybody
never let it stop
fill her up, fill her up... (repeat to fade)

Milk and honey
Your lips are milk and honey oh oh
Overflowing
You get my juices going

Sweet and tasty
Your love is sweet and tasty oh oh
Skin so creamy
Your body's soft and dreamy

Food for thought
You give me food for thought
Filling me up with your love
I can't control my hands

Champagne kisses
You give me champagne kisses oh oh
Cool my passion
Slow down my fast reaction

Hot and spicy
Your love is hot and spicy oh oh
Something's burning
Down in your life I'm turning

Food for thought
You give me food for thought
Filling me up with your love
I can't control my hands

Food for thought
You give me food for thought
Oh don't let me down
I'll starve without your love

Starve without your love
Starve without your love
Starve without your love
Starve without your love
Starve without your love

Something's cooking
I know that something's cooking oh oh
In your kitchen
I feel my hunger rising

So feed my senses
Come on and feed my senses oh oh
I'm not starving
I need a second helping

Food for thought
You give me food for thought
Filling me up with your love
I can't control my hands

Food for thought
You give me food for thought
Oh don't let me down
I'll starve without your love
<E>
<S>
The world is full of other people (ooh ooh)
Take a look around
We're quick to laugh when they've got troubles (ooh ooh)
And we put 'em down

We go
We're not so hot you know
It's like a roller coaster
On a downward motion

On a one way street
We can't control our feet
We're on the road to ruin
Don't know what we're doin'

She may be quiet
She may be shy
But don't you bring her down
Don't pass her by

The world of wisdom behind her eyes
Could answer everything
But you and I

We seem to wander in a daydream (ooh ooh)
We never look around
The world is full of other people (ooh ooh)
And we put 'em down

We go
We're not so hot you know
It's like a roller coaster
On a downward motion

On a one way street
We can't control our feet
We're on the road to ruin
Don't know what we're doin'

She's not beautiful
But don't make it plain
You underestimate
It's not a game

A heart of gold
Behind the drab
Would comfort anyone
But you and I

Should try to see it from the other side (oooh)
We'll get a shock
It could surprise you

The world is full of other people (ooh ooh)
Take a look around
We set the pace while others listen (ooh ooh)
Never make a sound

The rain must fall
But we can change
Our understanding
Will remain

So take a moment
To wonder why
The world keeps turning
For you and I
<E>
<S>
So say one and so say all
Say what you gotta say
Or don't say nothing at all
You been tossin' and turnin' through soft sticky nights
While the Bronx below you fights to stay alive

So say one and so say all
Be what you gotta be
Or don't be nothing at all

Be gracious to your mother
When you leave this neighborhood
The change is going to do her good
Next to me you look bad
'Cause there ain't no fresh air for my momma, my momma

But the drop is shear
When you break away

Take me away
It's just about time to hit the road
And say
You gotta believe in something
It's easy to see
My God is fading away
So pick up your bible and pray for me

We're all alone in the darkness
But our eyes are wide open
We don't see nothing
And our hands are tied
To the railings of the Bowery
And the humid city slickers

So say one and so say all
We had a lot to say
And we said it all

The cost of living in dreams
Is rising like a crime wave
The American way of dying

And it gets you every time
And it looks like it's got to my momma
My momma
May she rest in peace
<E>

From Rochdale to Ocho Rios
From Ocho Rios to Dorking
From Dorking its back to Rochdale
From Rochdale to Ocho Rios
You spend half your life in transit
But that's just the way God plans it
Pack a shirt and some fresh pajamas
That's all you need
Tried to get a flight out to San Juan
But Air Jamaica don't fly on Sunday
Gotta get a flight out to San Juan
Because I wanna see the Mama and the Papa
When I look into your blue eyes
I bend the truth but I never tell you lies
I need my lover, I need your care
Understandings not enough to make it fair
From Rochdale to Ocho Rios
From Ocho Rios to Dorking
From Dorking its back to Rochdale
From Rochdale to Ocho Rios
Asleep in a stream of sunlight
Awake in a dream at midnight
I'm rushing to wait for jumbo
Oh where am I now
Tried to get a flight out to San Juan
But Air Jamaica don't fly on Sunday
Gotta get a flight out to San Juan
Because I wanna see the Mama and the Papa
A dressing room so far from home
A corridor with a broken telephone
I wanna call but I got to go
The curtains up and it's time to do the show
Show time!
I just got in to the city
Yeah, it's so insane
But the man with the suitcase
is on the road again
Tried to get a flight out to San Juan
But Air Jamaica don't fly on Sunday
Gotta get a flight out to San Juan
Because I wanna see the Mama and the Papa
Asleep in a stream of sunlight
Awake in a dream at midnight
I'm rushing to wait for jumbo
Oh where am I now
You spend half your life in transit
But that's just the way God plans it
Pack a shirt and some fresh pajamas
That's all you need
Everybody sing!
From Rochdale to Ocho Rios
From Ocho Rios to Dorking
From Dorking its back to Rochdale
Oh where are we now

who's that creeping out of my back door
don't say he's collecting for the poor
don't you tell me you're not having fun
the green eyed monster's got me on the run
phones keep ringing but there's no one there
you never told me why you changed your hair
someone else's lotion on my side of the mattress
green eyed monster's got me by the niagra's
don't think i'm mad, it's paranoia
(i want what you got)
i'm sad, you're glad
(i want what you got)
i'm hungry for your love
say the word, give me fever
(you got what i need)
keep those goodies for me
midnight shopping is a funny thing
but i'm not laughing, you don't wear your ring
you spend a fortune but your cupboard's bare
the green eyed monster's got his home in there
somethings cooking at the laundromat
dirty washing, i'm not having that
fifteen visits and my threads are bare
the green eyed monster leaves me in despair
don't think i'm mad, it's paranoia
(i want what you got)
i'm sad, you're glad
(i want what you got)
hungry for your love
you say, the word, give me fever
(you got what i need)
keep that something for me
what the hell is happening here
the more i get to know
i find out how much i don't know
who can i turn to now
when everything i touch
and everything i see
seems to crumble into dust
you put the evil eye on me
green eyed monster's driving me insane
and jealous lovers play a deadly game
my fire is burning but you're as cold as ice
the green eyed monster throws a loaded dice
who's that creeping out of my back door
don't say he's collecting for the poor
don't you tell me you're not having fun
the green eyed monster's got me on the run
the green eyed monster's got me on the run
the green eyed monster's got me on the run

I got me a job on the local paper
Everybody there thinks I'm nice
But they'd better look twice
Cause it isn't me
I want to be

Headline hustler
Scandal maker

You keep writing me letters
But I haven't got time
I'm busy looking at photographs
But they'd better not be from the BBC
You're gonna hear from me

Scandal maker

Money taker

Better not turn around
I'll stab you in the back
And you don't know what I'm hiding
Under my plastic mac, under my plastic mac

I got a very good friend in the CIA
And he says that he never takes bribes
But he's telling lies
Cause he's into me
He knows I want to be

If your brother's wearing dresses
And your neighbor's swapped his wife
Well, I'm gonna make the headlines
With your private life
With your other wife

I've never been kissed before
It's been on my list before
A flick of the wrist before would do
But when you get down to it

It's got a good sound to it
Don't meddle around with it
'Cause it's far too wet to woo

When Mummy and Daddy play
They tell me to go away
But by hanging around
I can learn all the rules
Now I got the technique
I'm away

Develop a taste for it
A time and a place for it
Although on the face of it, it's a crime
I've nibbled the cheese of it

The birds and the bees of it
Are weak at the knees
From making honey
Every time

I'm throwing my toys away
I'm leaving the boys to play
With the boys
Gimme girls
And it's time I was breaking away

Just gimme some head room
Just a little bit of head room
I need some leg room
Just a little bit of leg room
I see myself Oh Lord
I see a mess

I'm making a meal of it
I'm breaking the seal of it
I'm getting the feel of what to do
It's got a good ring to it

I'm getting a thing for it
And if there's a sting in it
I'll have met my Waterloo
My Mummy and Daddy said
You're liable to wind up dead

Oo, they've been shooting me a line
Maybe it doesn't exist at all
Oo, I've been towing the line
Now I'm hook line and sinkered

I've never been kissed before
It's been on my list before
A flick of the wrist before would do
But when you get down to it

It's got a good sound to it
Don't meddle around with it
'Cause it's far too wet to woo

I've thrown all my toys away
I'm leaving the boys to play
With the girls that you get
For a dollar a day
When you pull on their strings they say

Just give me some head room
Just a little bit of head room
I need a ball room
Up against the wall room
I need the rest Oh Lord
I need the rest

Just gimme some head room
Just a little bit of head room
Take me to your bed-room
Show a little bit of leg room

I need the rest Oh Lord
I need the rest

Just gimme some head room
Just a little bit of head room
I need some head room
Just a little bit of head room
I need the rest Oh Lord
I need the rest

Just gimme some head room
Just a little bit of head room
I need some head room
Just a little bit of head room
I need the rest Oh Lord
I need the rest

My baby, she's crazy, she's lazy
So she's always bummin' around
Girls in France don't stand a chance
'Cos I've always got my baby around

So, don't touch her
Oh, it's so fine, and you know what's mine is mine

At night we, sleep tight we
Stay close together 'cos the temperature's down
But baby, says maybe
Each time I try to get my fingers around

So, don't touch her

Sittin' with a tentpole, what a bloody jamboree
Listen to our motto
Be prepared for ecstasy
Here comes the bride

My baby, goes topless
And brings her beauty to a bottomless day
She's bathing, al fresco
And all her mystery is there on display

So, don't get too close
Oh she's so fine, and you know what's mine is mine

Ooh, it's a drag when you're hitched to a dream
And the boys in the gang
Think she's part of the scenery
You're never alone and the tension is painful to see

One night I, crept in and
Got on my knees and tried to make her my wife
One reef knot, two grannies
And we were bound to stay together for life

Now we'd like to
<E>

On the other side of de island
There's a sky so clear and blue
Can see, cross water, to de mainland
New life for me and you

Let's buy a hotel
Let's get a yacht
We'll get a golden island
In the sun made of coconut
Let's buy an old car
We'll crash in a hut
We'll feed the food to the Ford
And we'll live off the coconut

Well there's a big black mama
In a tree
She's gonna cook us
She's gonna call up the rest of the tribe
And it looks like the ghost of Tarzan lied
He went over to the other side
And he rang like a bell
From tree to tree

They never ever let you go
They never ever let you go

We get American menus
With all American men
We're getting sick of things American
We ate our way through half the Pentagon
We had our share of big palookas

Yankee go home
Yankee go ho ho home

They never ever let you go
They never ever let you go

Yankee go home
Yankee go ho ho home

Let's buy a hotel
Let's get a yacht
We'll get a golden island
In the sun made of coconut
Let's buy an old car
We'll crash in a hut
We'll feed the food to the Ford
And we'll live off the coconut

Well there's a big black mama in a tree
She's gonna cook us
She's gonna call up the rest of the tribe
And it looks like the ghost of Tarzan lied

I've been thinkin' writin' you a letter
Maybe telegram would be better
I'll be worried how it's gonna get there
So I go and change my mind

Need a little time to chew it over
But every day I grow a little older
Got de devil sittin' on me shoulder
Gonna make me change my mind

Got me drinkin' even got me smokin'
Got me sinkin' nearly got me chokin'
What'll you do in the morning
What'll you do in the morning
When I'm gone

Thought I'd better have me a vacation
Got my ticket made my reservation
Want my name address and occupation
So I go and change my mind
How'm I ever gonna say goodbye
How'm I ever gonna go to sleep at night
How'm I ever gonna close my eyes
How'm I ever gonna sleep alone at night

I bought a flat
Diminished responsibility
You're de ninth person to see
To be suspended in a seventh
Major catastrophe
It's a minor point but gee
Augmented by the sharpness of your
See what I'm going through
Ay to be with you
In a flat by the sea

Iceberg, I've fallen in love with an
Iceberg, its only the tip of the
Iceberg, I've heard that it's cool

I got class, I got style
But once in a while out on the town
I must go
You'd better wash out your zone
Watch out you stone bone headed woman
Watch out you bone headed man

Iceberg-it's settlin' over Second Avenue
There's not a thing that you can
Iceberg-it's freezin' over Second Avenue
You'd better believe there's nothin'
You can do about it

I was an orphan and I couldn't help it
I've been in and out of trouble
Ever since they left me in a basket
On the freeway

It's me that's been doggin' your shadow
It's me that's been a shadowin' your dog
You got me hung up lock and stock and barrel
I'll always be behind you in the fog

So you better not annoy me
Or I'll do somethin' that I might regret
You'd better not annoy me or I'll do
Somethin' that you won't forget in a hurry
And I might be back for some sloppy seconds

You've heard me heavy breathing on the telephone
My word they say that I'm belongin'
In a home for crazy people
But you know I don't belong there
I was an orphan and I couldn't help it
I'd been in and out of trouble
Ever since they left me
In a basket on the freeway

Lie lie lie etc
Die die die (etc)
Hooray hooray ha ha ha
Hooray ha ha ha

Get down get down get down get down
There's really not a lot that you can do
Lay down lay down lay down lay down
There's really not a lot that you can do
There's really not a lot that you can do
And I might be back for sloppy seconds

I picked myself up in a downtown bar
You know the feelin' was lousy
But as I'd come this far
Well it's too easy to drink
When nobody's home
But I hate to eat alone
`N' frozen dinners don't do much for me
When you've got T.V. on the table
`N' T.V. on T.V.
All you do is chew your fingers
Down to the bone
I hate to eat alone
Like the actor who's forgotten his words
You stumble through the story line
Another place another time
When you were with me
They say the city's rotten to the core
There's no communication with each other anymore
But we stopped talkin' to each other a long time before
And I hate to eat alone
Hear it in my words
See it in my eyes
Since you went away
I wear a cheap disguise
Waitin' for the mornin'
Waitin' on the light
Hopin' for the sunshine
Before the night
I didn't tell you that I had to change
So you just took it for granted
That we'd remain the same
I know that nobody's guilty
No one's to blame so I end up on my own
God I hate to eat alone
I hate to eat alone
I hate to eat alone
I hate to eat alone

I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because
I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love, no no, it's because

I like to see you
But then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you
Don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us
I'm not in love, no no, it's because

I keep your picture
Upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there
So don't you ask me
To give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me
I'm not in love, no no, it's because

Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time
Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time
<E>

Hey you've been hanging on
To a dream
Hoping that time
Would turn your fear away
But you must stop
Take a look around
What do you see
Do you see me
People say that I'm crazy
(People call me a fool)
They've got no business to talk
(They've got no reason at all)
I'll take a chance with you Baby
It doesn't matter at all
It doesn't matter at all
It doesn't matter at all
Hey you're living in a world
Where reason is a waste of time
Nobody talking
The atmosphere is cold
Touching you deeply
Way down inside you
Do you wanna be loved
Say you wanna be loved
People say that I'm crazy
(People call me a fool)
They've got no business to talk
(They've got no reason at all)
I'll take a chance with you Baby
It doesn't matter at all
It doesn't matter at all
It doesn't matter at all
Hey I've been talked about
The way I've been following you
But I don't give a damn
When it feels so right
But I must find out
Take a look around me
What do I feel
What'll I do
You see I've been hanging on
To a dream
Hoping you'll find
The love you need in me
Giving you time
To make your mind up
Do you wanna be loved
Say you wanna be loved
People say that I'm crazy
(People call me a fool)
They've got no business to talk
(They've got no reason at all)
I'll take a chance with you Baby
It doesn't matter at all
It doesn't matter at all
It doesn't matter at all

I looked at your face somehow I knew
Nothing could tear me away
You started to smile and I was lost
Fumbling for something to say
I took you home, you took me in
I knew I'd never be the same again
Baby, isn't it funny how it started
Well you know

The windows were frosty and grey
But we didn't notice the cold
Wrapped in the warmth of your body
Hoping this dream would never go
I took you home, you took me in
I knew I'd never be the same again
Baby, isn't it funny how it started
Well you know

Your folks were sleeping soundly upstairs
We couldn't really turn on the light
So I stumbled and we fell in the dark
I could have died
It's crazy to remember all the reasoning
I wonder if the memory will ever fade away

I looked at your Father and I smiled
He said it was time for me to go
Stumbling out into the morning
Hoping my feelings didn't show
I took you home, you took me in
I knew I'd never be the same again
Baby, isn't it funny how it started
Well you know
<E>

I want to be a boss
I want to be a big boss
I want to boss the world around
I want to be the biggest boss
That ever bossed the world around

I want to do it right
I want to do it right away
I want to do it right now
I want to do it right away
I want to do it now

Don't want to be a dancer in the Bolshoi Ballet
Don't want to work for daddy
In daddy's shop, 0K
I get confused, so confused
I get a pain, I get a pain up here in the Shirley Temples

What you gonna do
How you gonna do it
What you gonna do
How you gonna do it

Little by little, ooh
Little by little, bit by bit

Sssh, not too loud, don't tell everybody
Don't give away the game
Oh, I ain't quite ready to reveal my campaign

This is not the time
My hero's are alive and well in a cave
I'm keeping them on ice in suspended animation
Till the very right occasion comes along

To our rally come along
Come along to our rally
Come along to our rally come along
To our rally come along
Come along to our rally
Come along to our rally come along

A Brave new world will rise from the ashes
And there upon a rock titanic
I'll cast a giant shadow on the face of the deep
And never again will they dare to call me
A freckled, spotty, specky, four eyed, weedy, little creep

No more tremblin' and quakin' in the gym
No more come on fellas, let's get him

What you gonna do
How you gonna do it
What you gonna do
How you gonna do it

Little by little, ooh
Little by little, bit by bit
Little by little, ooh, ooh
Little by little, bit by bit
Bit by bit, bit by bit

Everyone's going to be free
But they'll have to agree to be free
They'll have to agree to be less free than me
'Cause I rule the world you see
So wait for the army of kiddy-winkies
And terrible tiny tots
In armored school buses
Firing poison pea-shooters
And sinking their milk teeth into your thighs
Delapsus resurgam when I fall I shall rise

I want to be a boss
I want to be a big boss
I want to boss the world around
I want to be the biggest boss
That ever bossed the world around

Johnny don't do it
Johnny don't do it
Johnny don't do it
Johnny don't do it
Johnny was an angel
An angel dressed in black
He used to hang around the guys
Down at the local track
He tried so hard to join them
But they always turned him back
Johnny don't do it
He was an angel
Johnny don't do it
Such an angel
He was only 17
Just got out of school
He stole a bike from Joe's garage
To prove that he was cool
He didn't know that the brakes were worn
And fate can be so cruel
Johnny don't do it
He was an angel
Johnny don't do it
Such an angel
Johnny don't do it
Johnny don't do it
Johnny don't do it
Johnny don't do it
Well Johnny went a riding
With his girlfriend on the back seat
Looking for some action
And they found it down a back street
Suddenly a truck pulled out
He tried to step on the brake
Johnny don't do it (Here is a news flash)
Johnny don't do it (Today, Johnny Kowalski, also known as Johnny Angel)
Johnny don't do it (and his young fiance Francine, were tragically killed)
Johnny don't do it (in a cycle accident)
Don't do it, don't do it (any witnesses please contact)
Don't do it, don't do it (the police at Precinct 29)
Now Johnny's with the angels
The angels in the sky
I wonder if he thinks of us
As he goes riding by
If only had listened
Oh the number of times we tried
To tell him
Johnny don't do it
He was an angel
Johnny don't do it
Such an angel
Johnny don't do it
He was an angel
Johnny don't do it
Such an angel
Johnny don't do it
Johnny don't do it
Johnny don't do it
Johnny don't do it

Oh well her skin it was softer than velvet
And her eyes were as bright as a child's
Her lips were a promising picture
Warm and celluloid
But her words had me thinkin' too deeply
The meaning be-lying her face
Made me look just a little bit closer
Between the lines

L.A. smiles to hide the frown
L.A. promises to follow you down
L.A. teeth, and L.A. hair
L.A. curves that shouldn't be there
They really shouldn't be there

She said you've got to be seen at the Roxy
The strippers will know who we are
But you've got to be seen to be happy
You're a Tinseltown Star
You're going upwards and downwards and sideways
Man you're really caught up in a dream
With your head burning under the starlight
From the studio scene

L.A. smiles to hide the frown
L.A. promises to follow you down
L.A. teeth, and L.A. hair
L.A. curves that shouldn't be there
They really shouldn't be there

L.A. inflatable, she never says no
L.A. insatiable, you don't have to go
L.A. charisma

Well she knows all the famous musicians
Sometimes she sees how they play
And when the back stage passes are going
She really knows how to pay
She's a product of rock 'n' roll livin'
She's a victim of Hollywood hate
She's a soul survivor
She's the midnight special
Gonna lay you to waste

L.A. smiles to hide the frown
L.A. promises to follow you down
L.A. teeth, and L.A. hair
L.A. curves that shouldn't be there
They really shouldn't be there

Last night
You know you really really
Made me appreciate my life
When you took me to the seventh floor
And closed the door
I didn't stand a chance
Oh oh that night
When my conscience was losing
In that age old fight
Now I've always been a non-believer
A true deceiver
A hit and run romance

Don't you know that when we turned out the light
We were riding on the crest of a tidal wave
Like we were ships in the night
Going nowhere

Last night
When the feeling was missing
But the mood was right
From the moment we took the floor
I knew for sure
We'd play the parts we're expected to
I've done it so many times

Man we're all inmates of the human zoo
Our bodies in control of our minds
I played the jester and you played the fool
You kept forgetting your lines
I had to prompt you with a bourbon or two
Huh, you planned to come all the time

But when we turned out the light
We were riding on the crest of a tidal wave
Like we were ships in the night
Going nowhere (nowhere)

Oh last night
You know you really really
Gave me something to write about
In the morning it was just the same
I'd lost again
But it won't take me long to forget
Oh oh last night
<E>
<S>
Hazy Days
With Lazy Ways
You get less done but more
Out of your days
How can you work yet avoid
Getting out of your lazy ways
You'll never get up if you don't get up
You'll always stay down if you sit around
You'll never get up if you don't get up
You'll always stay down if you sit around
Hazy Days
Lazy Ways
We got less done but more
Out of our days
How can we ever recapture the feeling
Of lazy ways
You'll never get up if you don't get up
You'll always stay down if you sit around
Where nobody cares and nobody tries
'Cos a daydreams resting on the back of your eyes
On the back of your eyes
Taking five
Bring love to me
With your body
Let me hold you
Endless, endlessly
You'll never get up if you don't get up
You'll always stay down if you sit around
Where nobody cares and nobody tries
'Cos a daydreams resting on the back of your eyes
On the back of your eyes

Hazy days
Lazy ways
You get less done but more
Out of your days
Crazy days
Lazy ways

I could see that the sun it was deadly
She's putting her hand in the fire
Her velvety skin it was cooking
Lily white, lily white turning to raspberry
But when she slips in between the sheets tonight
The memory will linger and burn
And when she look at the face in the mirror
What a terrible sight
Lily white turning to raspberry
(When it burns you rub on the lotion
If it stings you sit in the ocean, oh no)

Les nouveaux riches, when they
Tres fatigue they fly, off to the sunshine
They set jet away, they don't
Get a kick, they don't get a buzz man
They, talk in circles, they not for us oh
Les nouveaux riches, when they
Tres fatigue they fly, off to the ocean
They hot foot away, they don't
Get a buzz, they don't get a kick
Man they, talk in circles
They must be thick, a say tick dem
A tick tick tick-a

I could see that the guys were a hassle
She tried to handle them cool
But her interbreeding was showing
Tumbling out on the banks of the old
Swimming pool, oh oh oh
So she buried her fears in a bottle
The juices beginning to flow
But her stiff upper lip it was trembling
Tripping her up, her words were beginning to roll
Hush your mouth, you can't fool the natives
Telegraph, they's going to relay it, oh no

Les nouveaux riches, when they
Tres fatigue they fly, off to the sunshine
They set jet away, they don't
Get a kick, they don't get a buzz man
They, talk in circles, they not for us oh
Les nouveaux riches, when they
Tres fatigue they fly, off to the ocean
They hot foot away, they don't
Get a buzz, they don't get a kick
Man they, talk in circles
They must be thick, a say tick dem
A tick tick tick-a

I remember the tears in her eyes
She tried to hide them away
But her time it was going too quickly
Just another few days, she'll soon be flying away
But her memory will stay here forever
A time she will never forget
All the sun and the sand and the water
Such a beautiful place, she never got her feet wet
No way, she keeping a cool head
She got a tan, from under the sun bed, oh no

Les nouveaux riches, when they
Tres fatigue they fly, off to the sunshine
They set jet away, they don't
Get a kick, they don't get a buzz man
They, talk in circles, they not for us oh
Les nouveaux riches, when they
Tres fatigue they fly, off to the ocean
They hot foot away, they don't
Get a buzz, they don't get a kick

Ten thousand miles away from someone
Ten thousand miles away from you
Who's your friend on the end of a telephone line
A telephone line's like a life line
You run me cool you run me hot love
You take me where I want to be
Ship to shore, air to land
Seems it's always the same
I always end up with a lame brain
Don't' got talkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Don't go walkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Don't' got talkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Don't go walkin' in your sleep no
You're ten thousand miles away
Livin' it up in the paradise
Don't make it right, don't make it wrong
When you know you've got a friend
Who's at the other end
And a telephone line's like a life line
But a walk on the wire
It don't put out no fire
A telephone line's like a life line
Don't' got talkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Don't go walkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Don't' got talkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Don't go walkin' in your sleep no
You're ten thousand miles away
When you wake you'll find me sleepin'
The clock don't stop when you're not here
But you know you've got a friend
Who's at the other end
And a telephone line's like a life line
A telephone line is a life line

I don't need no special things to get me high
All I needs a touch of Ron to get me by
I see people travelling, never make a move
I don't follow my leader, needles in the groove
I don't like sitar, it don't touch guitar
People selling me heaven, praying to the sky
I don't read their message
Listen with your eyes
Listen with your eyes
Listen with your eyes (I love it)
You've had a hustling day
Your life's roundabout anyway
I got my feet on the ground
That doesn't mean I don't get around
I get up on tops and down on Mr. Blue
I love to see a daybreak
It's not a chemical wide awake
I like a rub in the tub
I never want to pull out the plug
I get up on tops and down on Mr. Blue
Mr. Blue!
People search the dailies, live by horoscope
Looking for direction, don't they get the joke
I won't fear the reaper, when the curtain falls
I'm not vegetating, waiting for the call
I don't like sitar, it don't touch guitar
Wake up to the future, you should make your plans
Dreams are made in heaven, life is in your hands
Life is in your hands
Life is in your hands
Life is in your hands

Doctor, I'm getting in deeper
Show me, the way I can slow myself down
You can talk me round
I'm a fool for falling in love again
You've gotta save me
Take away the temptation
Wake me up when its over
Oh yeh, you've gotta talk me down
Talk me down

I'm calling Lovers Anonymous
I'm calling Lovers Anonymous
You talk about your troubles
And we throw you a line

Doctor, its draining my body
Help me, to pick up the pieces I've found
You can help me put them together again
You've gotta save me
Take away the temptation
Wake me up when its over
Oh yeh, you've gotta talk me down
You've gotta talk me down

I'm calling Lovers Anonymous
I'm calling Lovers Anonymous
You talk about your troubles
And we throw you a line

Call us up, we will answer night 'n' day
Talk to us, we're the ones who found the way

Doctor, its happened again, please
Help me, she's moving me more than a friend
And I'm heading for trouble
It's heaven again
You've gotta save me
Take away the temptation
Wake me up when it's over
Oh yeah, you've gotta talk me down
You've gotta talk me down

Time to wave the day goodbye
But I don't wanna hear no lullaby
Sandman takes his cue
And when the night is through
I'll be lying here with you
Close your eyes turn out the light
Say a prayer to see us through the night
Hope your dreams come true
When dawn turns into blue
I'll be lying here with you
Too much of something
Tends to spoil you so they say
But I can't get enough of you
I tell you something
I never listen to what they say
I only know what I must do
All our cares will drift away
Leave them all until another day
I don't really mind
As long as I can find
That I'm lying here with you
Too much of something
Tends to spoil you so they say
But I can't get enough of you
I tell you something
I never listen to what they say
I only know what I must do
All our cares will drift away
Leave them all until another day
I don't really mind
As long as I can find
That I'm lying here with you
<E>
<S>
Well I've been lookin' after number one
For too long
And it seemed that love was passing me by
So I thought I better do something about it
And that's why I'm sittin' here
Lookin' cross the table at you
That's why I'm sittin' here
Lookin' cross the table at you

Well a lonely man needs a marriage bureau
Where they sit you right down
And you fill in a form
Would you like a blonde or a black or a blue rinse
Do you like 'em small, love 'em slim long and tall
Do you like 'em small, love 'em slim long and tall
Oh no, too many questions

I'm looking for a girl like momma used to be
She's cooking up a dream, she's baking ecstasy
Won't it be fine when
I find her

Would I like to take her to a movie or the theatre
Would I pick her up at home
Or would I like to meet her
Somewhere we could take a good look at each other
Smile and say hello or walk away
Smile and say hello or walk away

So I'm squeaky clean in and out of the bath
I never shaved so close before
I'm gonna put on a tie
I'm gonna shine up my shoes
I'm gonna slick back my hair
I've got nothin' to lose
Oh, I'll be stinkin' so good
Like I'm drowning in a sea of cologne

(Hey) do you know you remind me of someone
(Ooh) but I'm here making eyes at you
And I think we're gonna say goodbye to the bureau
Close the files, turn the page, start anew
Close the files, turn the page, start anew
<E>

The summers were longer, they went on forever
Oh and the sky so blue
We never worried about anything
We didn't question the nature of things
We didn't want to know
Talking in whispers and wondering
Oh and I loved you so

Memories, they linger with you but you
Soon forget that we started in innocence
Memories, they linger with you but you
Soon forget when you're grown

We dream in the night, of mythical days
And nights in white satin
But when the child wakes, the fantasy breaks
We didn't know what the future would bring
We didn't want to know
Something was growing inside me
Oh and I loved you so

Memories, they linger with you but you
Soon forget that we started in innocence
Memories, they linger with you but you
Soon forget when you're grown

Photographs, faded photographs
Holidays, summer holidays
First love, broken promises
All a play, I'm going back to yesterday

The feeling was stronger, if went on forever
Oh and your eyes were true
We were so wrapped up in all of our dreams
We didn't care what the future would bring
We didn't want to know
Talking in whispers and wondering
Oh and I loved you so

Memories, they linger with you but you
Soon forget that we started in innocence
Memories, they linger with you but you
Soon forget when you're grown
<E>

I'm tired Lord and I'm drawn
And I'm chilled right to the bone
I crawled home from my work
And this note said she was gone
Said your dinner's in the cat
And your love is out the door
I'm goin' back to my momma
And I don't want you no more, no more
She said she don't want me no more
She's gone back to her momma
Said she's never never comin' back no more

Now a man can take so much
And only heaven knows his limit
But a naggin' bitchin' woman
Digs a hole and puts him in it
A sophisticated man
Needs a little something on the side
So what you don't get at home
You've gotta get outside, hey

She's gone
I'm spending all of my money
She's gone, gone, gone
And I can swing with my honey
She's gone
I'm so glad my woman's gone

Now time goes marching on
And it won't wait for you
You've gotta take it when it's offered
And get it when it's due
Now a man can move much faster
Without a millstone around his neck
So if you get the chance to lose it
You've gotta drop it and run like heck, hey

She's gone
I'm spending all of my money
She's gone, gone, gone
And I can swing with my honey
She's gone
I'm so glad my woman's gone

She's gone
I'm spending all of my money
She's gone, gone, gone
And I can swing with my honey
She's gone
I'm so glad my woman's gone
<E>

I checked into the room and I checked the view
And then I locked and chained the door
I had time to kill I had space to fill
Like a prisoner on the floor
But then the silence broke, there's a woman
screaming down the hall
And I wondered what was going on
Here at the Notell Hotel
So I killed the light and I slipped the chain
took a peek into the hall
I was just in time to see the waiter trip
and drop the dinner on the floor
But the Bellboy smiled as the elevator started to fall
And I wondered what was going on
down at the Notell Hotel
Ooh, I love a mystery (cover up and intrigue)
Life can be a thriller, a fantasy of everything I see
Ooh, how I love a mystery (turned up raincoats)
Secret agents, waiting for the missing clue
at a rendezvous
I heard the sound of feet and I looked out to
meet a girl I knew I'd seen before
She had the kind of looks, you see in dirty books
and she was dripping on the floor
She was taking a shower when someone tiptoed in
and turned out the lights
It's gonna be one of those nights
down at the Notell Hotel
I took her into my room and picked the lock on the bar
to get a drink to calm her down
Then the mirror cracked as the window shook
and the table turned around
And when I grabbed at the phone
there was a voice at the end of the line
"Is that 1059? Is anything wrong, Is there anything wrong"
here at the Notell Hotel
Ooh, I love a mystery (cover up and intrigue)
Life can be a thriller, a fantasy of everything I see
Ooh, how I love a mystery (turned up raincoats)
Secret agents, waiting for the missing clue
at a rendezvous
<E>
<S>
In the middle of a caravan
On a four wheel drive oasis
There's a man with a thought in mind
To cash in on the desert faces
He's got a truckload of Yorkshire girls
For your harem going places
And the border bums never saw
The guns in the whiskey cases

There's a real, big demand
And it's written in the palm of his hand
He's gonna change the face of the desert
He's gonna sweep away the sand

Hang on sheik, I've got a yellow streak
I ain't here, I'm a mirage
Get back Des, keep it under your fez
And don't give us away in the massage

Look what I did for the pyramid
I put a pool in and made it pay
I built an elevator and a film theater
And I shipped it to the U.S.A.

'Cause there's a real big demand
And it's written in the palm of my hand
I'm gonna change the face of the desert
I'm gonna sweep away the sand

Hang on friends
There's a lot more goodies in the pipeline
So this ain't the time to close the deal
Here's the deal
Ooh, now you've got a Howitzer all of your own
Ooh, and a Panzer division to chauffeur you home
Gun running is fun
But hang on, friends, hang on friends

Allah be praised, there's a whole new craze
We're gonna shoot up the foreign legion
And it's up with the sheik
And down with the frog
We're gonna liberate the region

Oh Effendi, we're gonna bury your head in the sand
Oh Effendi, you better get off my doggone land

Hey, Prince of the moonbeams
Son of the sun,
Light of a thousand stars
Your gorillas are urban
And there's bourbon on your turban
And the sun shines out of your ass

Oh Effendi, I'm gonna grovel in your wake
Oh Effendi, it's all been a big mistake

You're gonna cut out my liver
If I don't deliver
Things are getting out of hand
I'm going to ride off into the sunset and
Make a deal with the promised land

Goodbye friends
There's no more goodies in the pipeline
<E>

He looked funny
The children called him the scarecrow
An old raincoat
And baggy trousers and sneakers
he found at the dump
Oh, but if you bothered to look
There was something behind the rags
Oh there was a look in his eyes
It was something you'd never forget

He lived badly
A broken shack on the railway
An old moggy
The only one who replied
When he talked to the walls
Oh we didn't understand
We were fooled by the dirt on his face
Oh we were human then
We were searching behind his disgrace

Why don't you leave me alone
Why don't you go to your homes
Why don't you keep to yourselves
I'm tellin' you
Why don't you leave me alone

You're never gonna realize
When all you do is criticize
You're never gonna make it work
You never seem to get enough
You crumble when its getting rough
You're never gonna make it work
I'm tellin' you there'll come a day
You're gonna blow yourselves away
It's wrong that I should interfere
I just get in the way

Why don't you leave me alone
Why don't you go to your homes
Why don't you keep to yourselves
I'm tellin' you
Why don't you leave me alone

Deep into the night
He was working by the light
of the candle by his bed
on the theory in his head
He was building from the junk
that he rescued from the dump
And when he turned the power on
There was a sound and he was gone

Oh in the gray of the dawn
We discovered the thing he was working on
Oh we didn't understand
The future was Old Mister Time
Future was Old Mister Time
Future was Old Mister Time
Future was Old Mister Time
Old Mister Time (Mister Time, Mister Time)
Old Mister Time (Mister Time, Mister Time)
Old Mister Time (Mister Time, Mister Time)

Your heart is beating, eight to the bar
You can't control it so you hold it

You can't control the feeling

All in line
You say, Hey! Can I take you home tonight?
But she knows that you're throwin' a line
She's heard it before, she'll hear it again
It's the same pitch every time
Change your line of patter
Make her laugh, not at her
Change your line of patter
Make her laugh, not at her

She tells you her friend wants to say hello
But say that you don't want to know
It's her that you're throwing your glances to
Her that you want to know
Don't let her stray it's a Saturday night
The Boys are after trouble
You're in for a fight

She says if you're lookin' to take her home
Well I'd better not be in late
But the look on her face
And the smile in her eyes say
Baby I'm gonna wait
See the faces swimming
Hear the music dimming
Well I'm all danced out, I'm all done in
And I'm starting to talk out of tune
We can go on a ride, we can jump in a boat
We can dance by the light of the moon
One hundred and twenty five
Beats to, beats to the minute

I got a letter this morning
My overdraft's in overdrive
They wanna know what I'm gonna do about it
How I'm proposing to survive
Stay alive stay alive oooh
They want the money
so I work and work and work ......
They're making me roast
The cheque's in the post
You needn't worry worry worry....
You hit the roof when I'm on the floor
Did I ever let you down before
I got a letter from my broker
He say he broker than me
My silver mine has tarnished over
I'm on the road to tragedy
Help me, help me, oooooh
I need the money
so I work and work and work.....
I'm deeper in debt, I'm covered in sweat
You make me worry, worry, worry....
This nightmare's giving me the shakes
Hope I wake and find it's all a mistake
I started with nothing, and worked my way down
I know the things that I do, they mystify you
It's a strange way of living
But I like playing with fire
I'm always walking the wire
And when the tightrope snaps
You'll see my world collapse
I got a letter this morning
Must be my lucky day
Seems I've inherited a fortune
Rich Uncle Sam passed away, away, away, ooooh
I'm in the money
No more work and work and work.....
My banker's aghast, I'm dripping with cash
No need to worry, worry, worry.....
You need an angel to survive
An overdraft in overdrive

People in love do funny things
Walk under buses and burn their wings
People like us do nothing right
Talk to the ceiling into the night

Look at the smile in her eyes
I knew I was right in my bones
I feel the turnin' of wheels as it grows
Look at my face in her eyes
Am I right, am I wrong
She's given me butterflies all along

Oh sitting alone in the dark
Oh feeling you close to me
We're in a dream
But the hands on the clock seem to know
Tell me it's time to go

People in love play silly games
Running in circles and everywhere
People like us can make believe
Love is forever and I'll never be
<E>
<S>
There's a fat man who offers a change of scene
Says he'll guarantee my sheet will be clean
When I get on the outside
But who can you trust when the walls have ears
I'm for takin' a chance, like a drownin' man
I'm going under

I've got reds in my bed
I'm not easily led to the slaughter
And while the cold war exists
I'll stay warm with the commisar's daughter

We could meet at the zoo where the tiger roams
In a prison of steel
He reminds me so much of the way I feel
And we know that we're both in the danger zone
Where the eyes of the world
Full of shutters and bugs are upon us now

I've got reds in my bed
I get blues looking out of my window
And we're never alone, there's a tap on the phone
And my pillow

Let me go home
(There's a girl in a distant land)
Let me go home
(Who's nothing more than a memory)
She don't know that I'm gonna be free
Let me go home
(You're a land full of misery)
Let me go home
(You're a cruel and a faceless race)
I don't like your philosophy
I don't like your philosophy

The connections are made and the time is right
So my body is walled in the shell of a car
in the dead of night
And I laugh through the pain and the agony
As they cut me away to be born again
back to humanity

You've got reds in your bed
There's a man lookin' over your shoulder
But don't you give him your mind
It's too late when you find that it's over
You!

Let me go home
(You're a land full of misery)
Let me go home
(You're nothing more than a memory)
I don't like your philosophy
Let me go home
(You're a cruel and a faceless race)
Let me go home
(You're nothing more than a memory)
I don't like your philosophy
<E>

Listen while I sing you to sleep
With a rock 'n' roll lullaby
Close your eyes and don't you peep
This is a rock 'n' roll lullaby
Sandman's gonna get you
Snuggle down your sleepy head
It's gettin' late the Sandman said
Your dreams are waiting
It's daybreak in the land of nod
So get to sleep you little sod
Your dreams are waiting
And if you get a nightmare
Would you go and shake your Ma
Cause your Daddy's been a workin' all day
And if you go and get a glass of water by yourself
You can show us that you're older than you are
Show us that you're older
The Sandman's gonna get you
Well you're too young to understand
You're living in a wonderland
Your dreams are waitin'
If only we could be there too
And dream a dream along with you
Your dreams are waitin'
Careful that you don't get out the wrong side of the cot
Are you gonna be an angel or a devil
You're too small to reason what is right and what is wrong
Childhood dreams are gone too fast
There's no way we can make them last
We'll always love you anyway
Any way you are
Any way you are
<E>
<S>
I looked in the mirror
(What did you see looking at you?)
I saw a nine stone weakling
(What will you do?)

Dynamic tension waiting for you?
Dynamic tension make a man out of you

I opened my magazine
(What did you see?)
I saw Mr. France
(what did he have?)
A girl on each shoulder
(What else?)
And one in his pants

Dynamic tension can do this for you
Dynamic tension make a man out of
You you you you you

So our hero goes down to the beach
He's in real terrible shape
His chick's been seen with big Alex
That mother kicked sand in his face
Now let me tell you about Alex
He's got:
Hands like hams
Knees like trees
200 lbs
Of surfboard Hercules

Mr. atlas won't you bring her on back to me
I lost my girl down by the beach
She's with Alex and she's out of reach
So please Mr. Atlas won't you bring her on back to me
I saw your body in an advert on tv
But what convinced me was your money back guarantee

Now I'm stronger than Alex
(Where is he now?)
He's left in disgrace
(Oh yeah?)
'Cause I took back my girlfriend
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
And kicked sand in his face
(In his eyes, in his ears, in his nose)

Dynamic tension waiting for you
Dynamic tension make a man out of you
Dynamic tension, dynamic tension
Dynamic tension, dynamic tension

I've been lost before and I had to pay
It was never easy but I found a way
Well the journey was hard and the road was tough
There were times when I cried lord I've had enough
Please don't desert me now
Don't you leave me stranded now I need a friend
Please don't desert me now
You've gotta show me mercy when I'm helpless

Show me mercy when I'm helpless
Shine a light in the dark
Hold me back when I get reckless
Shine a light in the dark
Stand me up if I get legless
Shine a light in the dark
Shine a light in the dark
Shine a light in the dark

I've been down and out and I've been fit to drop
But the thought of you wouldn't let me stop
Now a man should stand upon his own two feet
Because the taste of failure is a bitter sweet
Please don't desert me now
I can hear the reaper calling in the wind
Please don't desert me now
You've gotta show me mercy when I'm helpless

Show me mercy when I'm helpless
Shine a light in the dark
Hold me back when I get reckless
Shine a light in the dark
Stand me up if I get legless
Shine a light in the dark
Shine a light in the dark
Shine a light in the dark

Where were you when the chips were down
I fell apart when I hit the town
Where were you when I couldn't get arrested
Where were you when the lights went out
I blew a fuse, did you hear me shout
Where on earth do I look for heavens sake

There's a brotherhood that I want to see
Gotta take my share of equality
There's no harmony in a one man band
Even god almighty needs a helping hand
Please don't desert me now
There's no time and I can't fight another day
Please don't desert me now
You've gotta show me mercy when I'm helpless

Show me mercy when I'm helpless
Shine a light in the dark
Hold me back when I get reckless
Shine a light in the dark
Stand me up if I get legless
Shine a light in the dark
Shine a light in the dark
Shine a light in the dark

Ships don't just disappear in the night
Do they?
People don't really die of fright
Do they?
We all know it just ain't so
So don't be afraid when the table shakes
Don't you
Don't be amazed when your shadow quakes
Don't you
Start to pray they'll go away
And then they can't do nothing to ya
They can't do nothing to ya
They just keep walking through ya
Better be nice to Vincent Price
Forces at work that we don't understand
Are they?
So don't get the shits if it touches your hand
Don't you
Poltergeists can be so nice
Better be nice to Vincent Price
What's that noise comin' up from the cellar?
What's it?
It's the restless bones of Boris and Bela
Boris and Bela
Don't go down, they're still around
But then they can't do nothing to ya
They can't do nothing to ya
They just keep walking through ya
And then they can't do nothin' to ya
They can't do nothin' to ya
They just keep walkin' through ya

I was travelling home on the subway
When this vision got on at Maida Vale
And as I casually eyed the classifieds
She sat down next to me
Every head in the carriage was wondering
I replied with a smile on my face
And as I slipped into the arms of Morpheus
To daydream the rest of the way
She was a smooth operator
You could see it in her dress
I said I'd like to see you later
But I didn't want to press
I was homing like a scanner
Did a mental strip tease
But she knew that she was special
And she came on like a tease
Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love
Not looking for tenderness
Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love
She was a headstrong woman
With a demon in her blood
Through the window in her eyes
I saw fire in her soul
And I knew if I pursued it
My fingers would be burned
Like a moth round a candle
I was momentarily stunned
Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love
Not looking for tenderness
Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love
The carriage was spinning
We were up on the floor
She was whirling like a dervish
I was whirling like a fool
My reactions were dimming
Like an alcoholic haze
I could hear people clapping
I was stumbling in a daze
I was stumbling in a daze
My eyes tried to focus
I was suddenly aware
She was newborn naked
I was altogether bare
There were shouts all around us
There were clothes on the floor
As I tried to find my senses
I was sliding down the door
Down a coal black tunnel
I was slipping away
Then I felt the water hit me
And I heard somebody say
Better get yourself together
This is the end of the line
When I looked for my woman
I'd been dreaming all the time
Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love
Not looking for tenderness
Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love

stealing coins from the poor box
i'm robbing the blind, but you won't
understand, i'm a wanted man
got no choice in the matter
i'm mad as a hatter
but she makes me do
things i shouldn't do
my baby wants the best of everything
i can't refuse her when she starts to sing
bring me something special
and i'll take you to heaven tonight
going down to the street and
i'll pick on a pocket with a
healthy wad, from some wealthy sod
looking tough with a shooter
i'll stick up the bank
and take out, all that cash
i'll be, such a smash
my baby needs the best of everything
lifes little luxuries to make her sing
bring me something special and i'll
take you to heaven tonight
look at her face and i won't need to explain
this is the stuff dreams are made of
step in my shoes and you will feel no pain
she's got the power to knock your socks off
my baby gets the best of everything
it's risky business but it makes her sing
bring me something special
and i'll, take you to heaven tonight
bring me something special
and i'll, take you to heaven tonight (2x)

Down on the casting couch
A star is gonna be born
A star with the stature of a Harlow
Who's doomed
And groomed to enrapture
All her co-stars, and stuntmen, the co-stars
Oh, let there be lights, action, sound
Lights, action, sound - Roll 'em!

Out in the mezzanine
On the arm of a dumb marine
Her beauty looks out like a trailer
Norman Mailer
Waits to nail her
He's under the bed
And he's waiting for her to be dead
He's out on the patio
With his polaroid and scenario
And he's armed and he's dangerously

Close was the weather
When I was a kid
She gave me a feather from her gown
To cool me down, to cool me down
And I was the galley slave
Who lost his heart when the ship went down

Lights, action, sound
Roll 'em

I had a part in the talkies
When you were a little girl
I've taken Lassie for walkies
When she was the pup that Vaudeville threw up
And destiny lead her
Hand in paw to somewhere
In Hollywood

That's crazy, a dog up in Beverly Hills
Crazy, crazy

La, la, la, la, la (You better lie low)
<E>
<S>
One fine day I started writing home
One finds
It's so hard
To make it

It's gotta be the right time
It's gotta be the right kind line
It's gotta be the mainline

It's gotta be
It better be
So let it be

One fine day
<E>
<S>
Baby Baby Baby don't hurry
You've got your finger on me
Don't let go, no no no
I know you love it
It's running through my veins
You drink me dry
You take so much of me
And when you touch me
I see the magic in your eyes
And I can't move (I'm going under)
One kiss, I know, that I'm with you
Forever
Baby Baby don't make me worry
You only live for the night
It's not right, no no no
But in the morning
You seem to disappear
Here come the night
You seem to reappear
Is this a warning?
I've got a feeling you're not
Telling me the truth (you cast no shadow)
One kiss, I know, that I'm with you
Forever
Strange Lover, pale as the moon
You've no shadow, no face in the mirror
No complection, no reflection
Baby Baby Baby you're freezing
You send a shiver through me
I'm so cold, no no no
The day is dawning
We're moving underground
I must go with you
I start to realise
Your touch is deadly
I wanna look away
But I can't look away
I'm in your power and I'm lost
<E>
<S>
This boy he's a midnight driver
High roller and a soul survivor
She tried to send him on his way
He say, hey, I wanna stay
If you don't mind I'm hanging around
This girl's on the road to nowhere
She wouldn't say but another day there
It's not the role she's decided to play
She say, hey, don't wanna stay
There's no reason for hanging around
Take me where I wanna go running
Where the sea rushes up to the shore
It's a lonely place but I need the space
Want to let my feelings soar
Help me find the key to my prison
I've waited long enough to be free
I love you but I'm not really living
It's now how I want it to be
Listen, I know what she's like she's just a dreamer
But I'll win in the end I'm a schemer
Give her time she'll be on the phone
She's never gonna make it alone
Better leave the door on the latch
She'll soon be hurrying home
Oh Mother, it looks like I'm in for stormy weather
So I'd better get my story together
Got to make it good she's no fool
I'll take her in my arms, I'll be cool
Don't want to get her upset
I wanna make her forget
Take me where I wanna go running
Where the sea rushes up to the shore
It's a lonely place but I need the space
Want to let my feelings soar
Help me find the key to my prison
I've waited long enough to be free
I love you but I'm not really living
It's now how I want it to be
This girl's she's a real survivor
She don't believe in the midnight driver
So she's starting a brand new day
She say, hey, don't wanna play
It had to stop, so I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
<E>
<S>
Baby baby oh baby
I'd love to love you
But my hands are tied
Break these chains
Oh oh these chains that are killing me

You don't need money if you've got love
We've got each other and its more than enough
Break these chains
Oh oh these chains that are holding me

Ooh ooh my love
It's all too much for me to take

Take these chains
Take these chains

She never thought that I could live without her
All the little things she used to do
Then I fell in love with you
You found me
You took me in
When no one wanted me

Making love on a sandy beach
The stars above us and we're clean out of reach
Of my chains
oh oh the chains that were killing me

And you make everything a paradise
And paradise with you is twice as nice
Never change, never change what you're doing to me

Never change
Never change
<E>
<S>
The hands on the clock seem to stick to the face
But the seconds are turning to minutes
I try not to look at the grin on it's face
And minutes to days
But I know that it knows that I gotta get out
Time to close the day
Of this place
time to greet the street
Time to lock the door
I'm so happy I'm walking on air
People staring but I don't care
Taxi, call a taxi, yellow taxi, taxi taxi
Don't take the subway don't go that way
'snot a safe way don't go that way
Gotta cross town don't want trouble
Got to get there on the double
She'll be thinking I'm not coming
She'll be waiting I'll be running
I can't wait to talk to you
Tell you what I'd like to do
We'll find a little restaurant
In the candlelight we're holding hands
A little vino for the ambiance
Don't want it to
The waiters are staring at me
Time flies when you really
Put your chairs on the tables
Leave us alone we don't wanna go home
But I've only got eyes for you
We can let ourselves out when you've gone
Time to take your home
Time to say goodnight
We don't wanna part
Let's be together tonight
Let's be together tonight
Taxi, call a taxi, yellow taxi, taxi taxi
Don't take the subway don't go that way
'snot a safe way we'll go our way
Pull the shades down screw the rat race
Gotta cross town back to my place
We're alone now undercover
Now I'm really close to you
Hang the sign out don't disturb
Tell you what I want to do
I wanna take you to a tropical place
Beneath the stars I'll see the love in your face
In the pale moonlight
Following the footprints in the sand
It's been a hell of a day in the city
We're holding hands
Now it's time to get away
<E>
<S>
You walk in the room
The folks are all there
With glasses in hand
But you can't take the band
So you head for the bar
The barman's well stocked
He knows where you're at
He offers a drink
But you can't take none of that
(No you can't take none of that)

Everybody's having fun
So why be the one
Who's out in the cold
It's not good enough
You made a deal with yourself
You said you'd never take another drop
Your craving's big, your livers shot
You'd give a million for a solitary drop

You take your first belt
It tastes like pure hell
The second one drops
Intentions are shot
Well you think you might as well
You take another sip
You get to likin' it
The music sounds hip
So you head for the floor
(So you head for the floor)
Yea yea yea yea yea

Well you step out on the dance floor
And you grab at your boss's wife
You've been longing to hold her close
For the whole of your working life
And the band played on

Move your ass
Well your hostess is lookin' mad
As your hands start to wander
And your boss is gonna get you now
He's gonna put you six feet under
You get walked out the door
And your feet don't touch the floor
You're never gonna see 'em no more

The dawn starts to break
Your heads a big ache
You're lyin' in bed
You're back from the dead
And your mouth feels like old leather
(Old leather)
Never do it again
(You'll never do it again)

Everyone was havin' fun
But you were the one
Kicked out in the cold
You slept in your clothes
You let 'em down
Down at the club
You know your confidence got to take the rub
Your boss is sore
You've had your chance
He says he never wants to see you again
Don't want to see you again
(Don't want to see you again)

You've got to dry out
The boys have found out
It's the end of the line
But it's martini time
So you head for the bar

Oh where am I now
<E>
<S>
Nobody sends me birthday cards
Nobody brings me flowers
I'm just here for operations
I've been out for hours
When I come to I'll wet my bed
'Cause when I get mad I sink so low
As matron knows

I get off on what you give me, darling
I get off on what you give to me
Yeah, I get off on what you give me, darling
I get off on what you give to me

And when I go to that seedy ward up in the sky
You'll be waiting with a hypodermic needle
And a graph

Here comes the dark
(I'm grateful for my anaesthetic)
Out goes the spark
(Delirious and apathetic)

When I come to I'll wet my bed
And when I get well I'll take revenge
I'll wreak my wrath
On all blood donors and their sisters
Visiting time and flowers
When sister brings that bedpan 'round
I'll piss like April showers

I get off on what you give me, darling
I get off on what you give to me
Yeah, I get off on what you give me, darling
I get off on what you give to me

I get off on what you give me, darling
I get off on what you give to me
Yeah, I get off on what you give me, darling
I get off on what you give to me

And when I go
I'll die of plaster casting love
<E>
<S>
Here's a new dance that you all can do
Baby, baby, what's he gonna do?
Sit back and relax `cos it's good for you
Baby, baby, what's he gonna do?
what's he gonna say?
He's takin' my breath away
Well if you're tired of doing the Boogaloo
And you're afraid of doing the Swim
`Cos you think you will drown
In the noise of the record
And the klutz on the floor
He ain't there anymore
`Cos all you wanna do
Is be alone at the bar
All you wanna do is be alone at the bar
You wanna drown in your cocktail
You wanna leave with the laundry
If your mind is trippin'
But your disc is slippin'
Here's what you gotta do -
Nothing
In any tempo and any rhythm
C'mon Mac do the sacro-iliac
C'mon back do the sacro-iliac
I said c'mon back do the sacro-iliac
Well it's easy
Here's the new dance that you 'll wanna do
So easy
Don't want to annoy ya with my paranoia
Now I'm doing the dance that is good for me
Baby, baby, what's it gonna be?
I ain't no Astaire, but I've a right to be
Baby, baby, when's he gonna learn?
Where's he gonna stay?
He's taken my breath away
Well I'm bored with the beat of the Shing-a-ling
And the Lindy is leaving me cold
`Cos I've never been freaky or funky or laid back
And the lush on the floor
Isn't me anymore
And I never ever wanna be alone
At the bar
Never ever wanna be alone at the bar
So C'mon Mac do the sacro-iliac
C'mon back do the sacro-iliac
Won't you c'mon back do the sacro-iliac
C'mon back do the sacro-iliac
Won't you come on back do the sacro-iliac
<E>

we came from miles around
just to listen to your sound
you made the night seem endless
you cast a magic spell
you played the part so well
your music blew away the darkness
we loved you for better
we loved you for worse
but we never took you for granted
your lives were a blessing
but they carried a curse
the night that the stars didn't show
you made me stand so proud
i was lifted from the crowd
the fire inside me burning
the figure dressed in black
sending shivers down my back
deep inside my soul was stirring
we loved you for better
we loved you for worse
the sweet inspiration that you gave us
and i can remember we didn't rehearse
the night that the stars didn't show
mountains may crumble
and worlds fall apart
lovers and friends may desert me
the road may be long
but i know in my heart
your spirit will always be with me
the thrill to be up there
a sea of faces everywhere
i look i find you
we loved you for better
we loved you for worse
but we never took you for granted
your lives were a blessing
but they carried a curse
the night that the stars didn't show
we loved you for better
we loved you for worse
the sweet inspiration that you gave us
and i can remember we didn't rehearse
the night that the stars didn't show

It's one thing to know it but another to admit
We're the worst band in the world
But we don't give a

If Garbo played guitar with Valentino on the drums
Then we'd be nothing more than a bunch of darma bums
So tune up, tune up

Well we've never done a days work in our life
And our records sell in zillions
It irrigates my heart with greed
To know that you adore me
Up yours, up mine
But up everybody's that takes time
But we're working on it
Working on it (Ooh)

We never seen the van - leave it to the roadies
Never met the roadies - leave them in the van
All because of circumstances way beyond control
We became the darlings of this thing called rock and roll, ooh

Here I am a record on a jukebox
A little piece of plastic with a hole, ooh
Play me
Buy me and you play me then my plastic turns to gold

Here we are together on your hi-fi
A little piece of plastic with a hole, oh
Fade me, fade me, fade me, fade me
<E>
<S>
Transistorised, and anodised
Chrome plated, squeaky clean
Oh Tokyo, oh Tokyo
Oh Tokyo I love you

You're trembling, you're choking
But you're magical to me
Oh Tokyo, oh Tokyo
Oh Tokyo I love you

Kimonos, and Geisha girls
From grade one, down to three
Oh Tokyo, oh Tokyo
Oh Tokyo I love you

Land of the rising sun
You have taken my heart away
With your beauty you nearly blinded me
In your beauty I want to stay

I bow to you with my heart
I think of you every day
When I dream you are there beside me
But when I waken you're far away

Perfection, in miniature
With tiny hands, smiling eyes
Oh Tokyo, oh Tokyo
Oh Tokyo I love you
Tokyo

when i dream you are there beside me

He was a gendarme
In the gendarmerie
Going Oh La La La
Oh La La La La
He was a pimp
In a black beret
But he was an artiste
In his own way
Oh La La La
Oh La La La La
When they raided my club that night
They ruined my act with the leather umbrella
the Chief de Police got a fright
He was up in my boudoir with some other fella
It's only routine
But I got this feeling
It ain't good for business
Then the floor cleared
A woman screamed to herself
Henri...Though you're not the toast of Paris
I love you, although you bed and beat me
Henri, leave it alone,
For the gendarme's just doing his job
Paris is only one step away
Murder is only one step away
Notre Dame is ringing her bells
Another gendarme has gone to Hell
Notre Dame is ringing her bells
Another gendarme has gone to Hell
Gone to Hell
Gone to Hell
One night in Paris
Is like a year in any other place
One night in Paris
Will wipe the smile off your pretty face
One girl in Paris
Is like loving every woman
This night in Paris
This night in Paris
This night in Paris
This night in Paris
May be your last!!!

I kissed my mother
shook the hand of my brother
and i said goodbye to the woman i loved
it may seem like a madness
to be leaving the love nest
but i'm taking a chance on a place far away
welcome to paradise
who said you can't live twice
you will find heaven is here on earth
welcome to paradise
did somebody say . . .
there's a coup coming on
there's a coup coming on
there's a coup coming on
there's a coup coming on
a coup coming on
bad vibrations (there's a coup coming on)
feeling the tension (there's a coup coming on)
no smoke without fire (there's a coup coming on)
i could smell the danger
never dance with a stranger
but the music took me and soon i was lost
so i questioned a lady
but her answers were crazy
and before i knew i was counting the cost
welcome to paradise
love it but don't look twice
you'll soon be living in make believe
welcome to paradise
did somebody say . . .
there's a coup coming on
there's a coup coming on
there's a coup coming on
there's a coup coming on
a coup coming on
somebody help me (there's a coup coming on)
(welcome to paradise)
so much i don't follow (there's a coup coming on)
(welcome to paradise)
i'm not looking for trouble (there's a coup coming on)
(welcome to paradise)
there's a coup coming on
a coup coming on
i shouldn't have come
no i shouldn't have come
why did i come, hey!
the clouds were gathering
and the temperature rising
be no turning back all my bridges were burned
then it hit me, jumped up and bit me
now i'm under your spell i can never return
this is your paradise
now you must pay the price
you should have flown
when the coup was blown
welcome to paradise
did somebody say . . .
there's a coup coming on
there's a coup coming on
there's a coup coming on
there's a coup coming on
a coup coming on
A band on the run

You're through gestation so welcome to the world
We've still got vacancies just waiting to be filled
We're still delivering ten thousand souls a day
And disproportionately packing them away

The starving of the multitudes and the feeding of the few
We're only humanoid there's nothing we can do
You must do something or we'll all go up in smoke
We'd like to help but we're afraid of losing votes

They never listen to you
They never listen to your cries
We're not progressing we're only marking time
You're on your own

Think of your children
Think of your children
Are they welcome to the world?

If every Chinaman jumped up and down in sync
Then California would be sucked into the drink
You've all got bodies and a few of you got minds
We'd like to juse them but we never get the time

Though man's achievements are a credit to us all
How come we're stading with our backs against the wall?
One thousand congressmen assemble every day
They'll send us packing on a dreadlock holiday

They'll never listen to you
They'll never listen to your cries
They'll keep on talking and wasting precious time
You're on your own

Think of your children
Think of your children
Look to your children
They're only children
Are they welcome to the world?

I don't know why it's the way of the world
but meanwhile....
you've seen her sway when she walks down the street
look at her eyes see the glow in her cheeks
it ain't no secret she can't hide it away
there's someone special she's the dish of the day
she's a woman in love
she's a woman in her prime
(she's a woman in love)
look at her face it's a picture
she's a woman in love
she's a woman
this chemistry you'll never find in a book
no Ectochrome's gonna capture this look
these mixed emo's make your senses to reel
you've got to be there to feel what she feels
she's a woman in love
she's a woman in her prime
(she's a woman in love)
look at her face it's a picture
she's a woman in love
she's a woman
why should a woman in all innocence
be the one to inspire looks that kill
i don't know
i don't know why it's the way of the world
some will win, some will lose
but she can't tell
this kind of beauty comes from within
shouldn't be allowed yeh it's really a sin
you'd sell your soul for a night in her bed
you're far too late boy I've already said
she's a woman in love
she's a woman in her prime
(she's a woman in love)
look at her face it's a picture
she's a woman in love
she's a woman
(repeat until fade)

I want to take a giant step
Don't know where I'll end up yet
The devil or the deep blue sea
There's always someone watching over me
The power of communication
Every little word's a big sensation
Sitting in the palm of my hand
Everyone at my command

It's a wonderland
(And I've only just begun)
(But I get a smile from everyone)
It's a wonderland
(Makes no difference, day or night)
('Cause I won't go down without a fight)

I'd like to introduce you to
A special substance, good for you
No physical dependency
For a star in its ascendancy
The world is a great big oyster
I'm riding through on a roller coaster
I'm looking at exotic places
But I'm colour blind to all these faces

It's a wonderland
(And I've only just begun)
(But I get a smile from everyone)
It's a wonderland
(Makes no difference, day or night)
('Cause I won't go down without a fight)

Live while you can
Everyday's a holiday
These are the golden years
And they won't be coming round again
So little time to be wild and free
So many things that you want to be
So little space between the cradle and the grave
But the minutes are ticking away
These are the special times
And they won't be coming round again woh oh woh

People take me for a ride
But I'm feeling good inside
The consequence of love and pain
And I'm not the one who takes the blame
My head is on another planet
My thoughts are soothed
By the hands upon it
A simple trade in real affection
And I'm not alone in the twilight zone

It's a wonderland
(And I've only just begun)
(But I get a smile from everyone)
It's a wonderland
(Makes no difference, day or night)
('Cause I won't go down without a fight)

It's a wonderland
(And I've only just begun)
(But I get a smile from everyone)
It's a wonderland
(Makes no difference, day or night)
('Cause I won't go down without a fight)

It's a wonderland....

Working girls don't stand a chance
Typing pools are full deadly fish
Office Romeos believe
Dictation is the statutory dish
Do they want you for your body
When you wanna use your mind
Every day it's hustle hustle
But you're not the pushy kind
You worry and wonder when he calls you at five
You've got to work late will you get out alive
You know what he's after it's always the same
And soon you'll be playing the cat and mouse game
Working girls they dress to kill
Posing for some glossy magazine
You know the flashman wants an exposure
But your momma says you gotta keep it clean
Still you're selling with your body
And the camera never lies
Every shot is more revealing
As your inhibitions die
He asks you to stay but you want to decline
He leers as he opens another bottle of wine
Don't want to offend him your ticket to fame
So you play by the rules
It's a cat and mouse game
Working girls are lost in dreams
Buried in a paperback romance
Why don't you wake up to reality
And watch those fingers at the office dance
When you're struggling with your figures
Is he studying your form?
There's a silence in the boardroom
It's the calm before the storm
You wanna go home it's been a long day
The streets are so crowded and you must get away
You'll be back tomorrow
He'll call out your name
It's business as usual
The cat and mouse game
Working girls
Working girls
Working girls

You never asked me to love you
I did it all by myself
You didn't make me no promises
You read my feelings so well

[CHORUS]
Oh wow wow what you've done for me
Oh wow wow even a fool could see
Oh wow wow what you mean to me

You didn't ask no questions
I wouldn't tell you no lies
I didn't need any answers
They were there in your eyes
Don't stop me from falling
I can't get enough
You took the pain from my body
Now I'm ready for love
Yes I am

I've been alone in the shadows
Too many nights by myself
So many dreams have been shattered
You know the story so well

[CHORUS]

I didn't see no fireworks
And the earth never moved
But when we're lying together
I've got nothing to prove
You gave me your kisses I can't get enough
You put the fire in my heart
And I'm ready for love
Yes I am

People try to analyse
They worry is it right
But it really doesn't matter to me
There's no reason when you really fall in love
'Cause you can't stop it
Won't drop it
Don't even think about it
Hold on tight and never let it go

[CHORUS]

You took the pain from my body
And I'm ready for love
You took the pain from my body
And I'm ready for love
Yes I am ready for love
Yes I am ready for love
Yes I am ready for love
Yes I am

Your nose is runnin'
And your eyes are red
Your head is achin'
You'd be better in bed
From the bottom of your fever
To the throbbing in your toes
You've got a cold
You've got a cold

You're searching madly
To find a cure
But the mercury's rising
To a hundred and four
You've got a beauty, a bad ass
The mother of them all
You've got a cold
You've got a cold

Ain't no use in fightin' it
Get into bed and try to sweat it out

Hot toddies won't help you
Warm blankets won't sweat it out
Inhalants just choke you
Hot flushes will tell you
Anyway you've got it
Ain't no doubt about it
Nothin' new about
You can scream and shout it

Hot toddies won't help you
Warm blankets won't sweat it out
Inhalants just choke you
Hot flushes will tell you
Anyway you've got it
Ain't no doubt about it
Nothin' new about
You can't fight it

Foreign bodies in your Kleenex
You've got no taste at all
While your system is dyin'
The bugs are havin' a ball
You've got a beauty, a bad ass
The mother of them all
You've got a cold
You've got a cold

I treat you like a woman
So treat me like a man
I took you to a better place
And helped you understand

[Chorus]
So don't squeeze me like toothpaste
Like putty in your hands
I'm gonna go away, I'm gonna blow away

A woman is a woman
And a man is just a fool
It takes all of the heartaches
And life can be so cruel

[Chorus]

Who's gonna be there when the morning comes?
Head on the pillow, smiling at me
I get up and make the coffee
It must be love, it must be love

Who's gonna be there when the morning comes?
Head on the pillow, smiling at me
I get up and make the coffee
It must be love, it must be love

I treat you like a woman
So treat me like a man
I took you to a better place
And helped you understand

[Chorus]
<E>

Gimme your body
Gimme your mind
Open your heart
Pull down the blind
Gimme your love gimme it all
Gimme in the kitchen gimme in the hall
Art for arts sake
Money for Gods sake
Art for Arts sake
Money for Gods sake
Gimme the readys
Gimme the cash
Gimme a bullet
Gimme a smash
Gimme a silver gimme a gold
Make it a million for when I get old
Art for arts sake
Money for Gods sake
Art for Arts sake
Money for Gods sake
Money talks so listen to it
Money talks to me
Anyone can understand it
Money can't be beat Oh no
When you get down, down to the root
Don't give a damn don't give a hoot
Still gotta keep makin the loot
Chauffeur driven
Gotta make her quick as you can
Give her lovin' make you a man
Get her in the palm of your hand
Bread from Heaven
Gimme a country
Where I can be free
Don't need the unions
Strangling me
Keep me in exile the rest of my days
Burn me in hell but as long as it pays
Art for arts sake
Money for Gods sake
Art for arts sake
Money for Gods sake
Art for arts sake
Money for Gods sake
Art for arts sake
Money for Gods sake

She doesn't need money
She doesn't need diamonds
She's lookin' for pretty things
She doesn't want romance

She doesn't need finance
She's looking for rendezvous
But every time she's going down
She never looks around

I'll wait and watch her with my
Lens until she brings the curtain down
'There behind the keyhole'
With my fisheye

I'm back in the darkroom
I'm covered in fixer
I'm making a photograph
I'll send her some postcards

In glorious colour
I'm keeping the negatives
I'll form a letter from the news
With different type from different lines

I'll tell the world about her
I'll mail the People and the Times
'Oo it'll be so scandalous
For the both of them

But mainly her'
She showed them her husband
He ordered a dozen
He thought they were fabulous

The one with the --
The two of the --
And three of the --

He sold her to Hefner
Who put her in Playboy
He gave her a centre-fold
I made a real blunder

She made it in movies
I made her a superstar

Well it's cold down here in the water
It's cold down here in the sea
Who'd be a channel swimmer?
Only a fool like me

I've greased my body
And I'm heading over the ocean
These two arms are the only locomotion
I need

See me swim and see me float
I don't need no motorboat
Or a yacht to get me there

I'll do the breaststroke
And the backstroke

I'll do anything
I'll be swimming when you're all asleep
I'll be swimming when you're all awake
I'll do the sidestroke

The other sidestroke
I'll do the butterfly
But I ain't gonna crawl
On back to you, no way

I see your face in every breaker
I see your smile across the reef
I came across the sea to take you
Don't make me out to be a thief

You'll be dreaming when you're all asleep
But I'll be drowning when you're all awake

I did the breaststroke
I did my best stroke
I did everything
But I ain't good enough

'Cause it's cold down here in the water
It's cold down here in the sea
Who'd be a channel swimmer?
Only a fool like me

Who'd be a channel swimmer?
Only a fool like me
Would forget he can't swim

Oh Donna

Meanwhile waiting by the telephone
Donna is waiting for the phone to ring

"Hello, darling
Yes I love you darling

Oh Donna

You made me sit down, Donna
Sit down, Donna

Hello there
How have you been
I've called a million times
But to me you're never in
I know I never had the style
or dash of Errol Flynn
But I loved you

I'm doing really well
I'm as happy as a lark
I got a new apartment
It's as safe as Central Park
And if they ever mug me
When I'm walking in the dark
Will you know

Don't hang up
Don't hang up

Rolled up in my camera
With the big cheese up above
I stumbled from my stag night
To a never ending limousine

The band went la di da di da
And I got loady do di dodied
Lousy violins began to play
I went no no no
And as the vol-au-vents exploded
I was walking down the aisle the other way

Don't hang up
Don't hang up
Don't say, oh
Nobody's safe in our house

Leave me alone
But a but a please
Leave me alone
Just a mo, a minute
I'm so alone

We had
Some honeymoon on itchy bedding
Scum buzzing round your busy body
Dumb waiters waiting sweating straining
All mass-debating my woman

We got a
Bum Guatemala pensione
Crumbling about our ears, Ole
Even the trash man he say

You got a dustbin romance
It's going down the drain
You got a low impedance
She's got a rocky terrain

Oh, you got a lot to learn
Oh, you got a lot to learn
You got a lot to learn about women
A lot to learn about women women
What's to learn about women
We've both got a lot to learn

Surprise surprise
There's a hell of a well in your eyes
Have we won the no Nobel Prize
Has the color run out of our dyes

Surprise surprise
There's a hell of a well in your eyes
When the barman said "What're you drinking?"
I said marriage on the rocks

I know I never had the style
or dash of Errol Flynn
But I loved you

Don't hang up
Don't hang up
Don't say
<E>
<S>
I was walkin' down the street
Concentratin' on truckin' right
I heard a dark voice beside of me
And I looked 'round in a state of fright
I saw four faces, one mad, a brother from the gutter
They looked me up and down a bit and turned to each other

I say, I don't like cricket, oh no, I love it
I don't like cricket, oh no, I love it
Don't you walk through my words
You got to show some respect
Don't you walk through my words
Cause you ain't heard me out yet

Well, he looked down on my silver chain
He said: I'll give you one dollar
I said: You've got to be jokin, man
It was a present from me mother
He said: I like it, I want it, I'll take it off your hands
And you'll be sorry you crossed me
You better understand that you're alone (a long way from home)

And I say, I don't like reggae, oh no, I love it
I don't like reggae, I love it
Don't you cramp me style
Don't you queer me pitch
Don't you walk through my words
Cause you ain't heard me out yet

I hurried back to the swimming pool, sinkin' pina colada
I heard a dark voice beside me say
Would you like something harder?
She said: I've got it, you want it
My harvest is the best, and if you try it
You'll like it and wallow in a dreadlock holiday

And I say, don't like Jamaica, oh no, I love her
Don't like Jamaica, oh no, I love her
Don't you walk through my words
You got to show some respect
Don't you walk through my words
Cause you ain't heard me out yet
I don't like cricket, oh no, I love it (Dreadlock holiday)
I don't like Reggae, oh no, I love it (Dreadlock holiday)
I don't like Jamaica, oh no, I love her (Dreadlock holiday)

You went out on the street without your shoes on
You didn't listen what your momma said
She said you won't feel the benefit, won't feel the benefit
And if we all went out without our shoes on
Tell me where would we be, where would we be

If all the people in the world lost their reason
What would we see, where would we be
If all the entertainers in the world lost their music
What would they play, what could they say
To pacify the crowd, to justify themselves
Won't feel the benefit

You're like a cloud behind the sun
Like the face behind the clown
You're moving like the wrinkles in a frown
And you can never look back

A leaf that's borne upon the wind
A cardboard suitcase in your hand
The wanderer soon returns
And finds the colour of the grass is just the same
On the other side of the tracks, oh no

Ooh when you smile it's like a holiday
Ooh pack your bags and we can get away
We'll float on a Queen down to Rio
There's no need to shave
We'll be stinking like rum in a punch

You can walk on the water
You can dabble in the mumbo jumbo
You can smoke a little ganja
Float like a cloud over Rio, Rio

You can ride with the Gauchos
Swinging your bolas in a red bandana
You can run with the devil
Takin' your chances with Senorita

You can drink a lot of coffee in Brazil
But the bill is gonna make you ill

Feel the benefit

So, you can go out on the street and take your chances
But if you do, you better do it right
Or you won't feel the benefit, won't feel the benefit
Spin the wheel and take your chances
And your number might come up
Though the odds may be in favor of the house

If all the people in the world would say together
We're all black and white, we're all day and night
If all the people in the world could sing together
How would it sound, what would we feel

We'd all feel the benefit

Oo he's a sly one
He's a razamataz man
He flew in from Singapore
On a flying junk man
Oo he's a devil
Oo and the devil's gonna bring you down

Oo he's a stalwart
With a heavy load on
He's got a finger in everyone's pie
And he's got what you want
Oo he's a salesman
Oo and his goods are gonna bring you down

He's never got the stuff
If you ever come to him without money
He hasn't got the time
For the people who are down on their knees
But if the price is right
You won't be asking him where it came from

Oo he's a remnant
From the swingin' sixties
He pushed his load down the Kings Road
To the Chelsea Potter
Oo he's a snow job
Oo and his shovels gonna cover you
<E>
<S>
The world is full of other people (ooh ooh)
Take a look around
We're quick to laugh when they've got troubles (ooh ooh)
And we put 'em down

We go
We're not so hot you know
It's like a roller coaster
On a downward motion

On a one way street
We can't control our feet
We're on the road to ruin
Don't know what we're doin'

She may be quiet
She may be shy
But don't you bring her down
Don't pass her by

The world of wisdom behind her eyes
Could answer everything
But you and I

We seem to wander in a daydream (ooh ooh)
We never look around
The world is full of other people (ooh ooh)
And we put 'em down

We go
We're not so hot you know
It's like a roller coaster
On a downward motion

On a one way street
We can't control our feet
We're on the road to ruin
Don't know what we're doin'

She's not beautiful
But don't make it plain
You underestimate
It's not a game

A heart of gold
Behind the drab
Would comfort anyone
But you and I

Should try to see it from the other side (oooh)
We'll get a shock
It could surprise you

The world is full of other people (ooh ooh)
Take a look around
We set the pace while others listen (ooh ooh)
Never make a sound

The rain must fall
But we can change
Our understanding
Will remain

So take a moment
To wonder why
The world keeps turning
For you and I
<E>
<S>
Well good morning Judge, how are you today
I'm in trouble, please put me away
A pretty thing took a shine to me
I couldn't stop her, so I let it be

I couldn't stop her, so I let it be
I couldn't stop her, so I let it be
I couldn't stop her, so I let it be

He didn't do it, he wasn't there
He didn't want it, he wouldn't dare

Well good morning Judge, yes I'm back again
I'm in trouble, so it's back to the pen
I found a car, but I couldn't pay
I fell in love, and I drove it away

I fell in love, and I drove it away
I fell in love, and I drove it away
I fell in love, and I drove it away

He didn't do it, he wasn't there
He didn't want it, he wouldn't dare
I didn't do it, I wasn't there
I didn't want it, I wouldn't dare

Alcatraz is like a home sweet home
I'm so wanted, and I'm never alone
San Quentin is the place to be
I'm so happy, I don't want to be free

So happy I don't want to be free
So happy I don't want to be free
So happy I don't want to be free

On the other side of de island
There's a sky so clear and blue
Can see, cross water, to de mainland
New life for me and you

Let's buy a hotel
Let's get a yacht
We'll get a golden island
In the sun made of coconut
Let's buy an old car
We'll crash in a hut
We'll feed the food to the Ford
And we'll live off the coconut

Well there's a big black mama
In a tree
She's gonna cook us
She's gonna call up the rest of the tribe
And it looks like the ghost of Tarzan lied
He went over to the other side
And he rang like a bell
From tree to tree

They never ever let you go
They never ever let you go

We get American menus
With all American men
We're getting sick of things American
We ate our way through half the Pentagon
We had our share of big palookas

Yankee go home
Yankee go ho ho home

They never ever let you go
They never ever let you go

Yankee go home
Yankee go ho ho home

Let's buy a hotel
Let's get a yacht
We'll get a golden island
In the sun made of coconut
Let's buy an old car
We'll crash in a hut
We'll feed the food to the Ford
And we'll live off the coconut

Well there's a big black mama in a tree
She's gonna cook us
She's gonna call up the rest of the tribe
And it looks like the ghost of Tarzan lied
He went over to the other side

From tree to tree
Tree to tree, tree to tree

Just like a rollin' stone
I'm outside lookin' in
But if your chance came would you take it
Where on earth do I begin
I'm Mandy fly me

I've often heard her jingle
It's never struck a chord
With a smile as bright as sunshine
She called me through the poster
And welcomed me aboard
She led me she fed me
She read me like a book
But I'm hiding in the small print
Won't you take another look
And take me away
Try me Mandy fly me away

The world was spinning like a ball
And then it wasn't there at all
And as my heart began to fall

I saw her walking on the water
As the sharks were comin' for me
I felt Mandy pull me up give me the kiss of life
Just like the girl in Dr. No No No No

Ah when they pulled me from the wreckage
And her body couldn't be found
Was it in my mind it seems
I had a crazy dream
I told them so but they said no no no no

I found me on a street
And starin' at a wall
If it hadn't have been for Mandy
Her promise up above me
Well I wouldn't be here at all
So if you're travellin' in the sky
Don't be surprised if someone said Hi
I'm Mandy fly me
<E>
<S>
I'm dancing on the White House lawn
Sipping tea by the Taj Mahal at dawn
Hanging round the gardens of Babylon
Minnie Mouse has got it all sewn up
She gets more fan mail than the Pope
She takes the mickey out of all my phobias
Like signing cheques to ward off double pneumonia

Life is a minestrone
Served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold Lasagne
Suspended in deep freeze

I'm leaning on the Tower of Pisa
Had an eyeful of the tower in France
I'm hanging round the gardens of Madison

And the seat of learning
And the flush of success
Relieves a constipated mind
I'm like a gourmet in a skid row diner
A fitting menu for a dilettante

Life is a minestrone
Served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold Lasagne
Suspended in deep freeze
Love is a fire of flaming brandy
Upon a crepe suzette
Let's get this romance cooking, honey
But let us not forget

Life is a minestrone
Served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold Lasagne
Suspended in deep freeze
<E>

I'm tired Lord and I'm drawn
And I'm chilled right to the bone
I crawled home from my work
And this note said she was gone
Said your dinner's in the cat
And your love is out the door
I'm goin' back to my momma
And I don't want you no more, no more
She said she don't want me no more
She's gone back to her momma
Said she's never never comin' back no more

Now a man can take so much
And only heaven knows his limit
But a naggin' bitchin' woman
Digs a hole and puts him in it
A sophisticated man
Needs a little something on the side
So what you don't get at home
You've gotta get outside, hey

She's gone
I'm spending all of my money
She's gone, gone, gone
And I can swing with my honey
She's gone
I'm so glad my woman's gone

Now time goes marching on
And it won't wait for you
You've gotta take it when it's offered
And get it when it's due
Now a man can move much faster
Without a millstone around his neck
So if you get the chance to lose it
You've gotta drop it and run like heck, hey

She's gone
I'm spending all of my money
She's gone, gone, gone
And I can swing with my honey
She's gone
I'm so glad my woman's gone

She's gone
I'm spending all of my money
She's gone, gone, gone
And I can swing with my honey
She's gone
I'm so glad my woman's gone

In the middle of a caravan
On a four wheel drive oasis
There's a man with a thought in mind
To cash in on the desert faces
He's got a truckload of Yorkshire girls
For your harem going places
And the border bums never saw
The guns in the whiskey cases

There's a real, big demand
And it's written in the palm of his hand
He's gonna change the face of the desert
He's gonna sweep away the sand

Hang on sheik, I've got a yellow streak
I ain't here, I'm a mirage
Get back Des, keep it under your fez
And don't give us away in the massage

Look what I did for the pyramid
I put a pool in and made it pay
I built an elevator and a film theater
And I shipped it to the U.S.A.

'Cause there's a real big demand
And it's written in the palm of my hand
I'm gonna change the face of the desert
I'm gonna sweep away the sand

Hang on friends
There's a lot more goodies in the pipeline
So this ain't the time to close the deal
Here's the deal
Ooh, now you've got a Howitzer all of your own
Ooh, and a Panzer division to chauffeur you home
Gun running is fun
But hang on, friends, hang on friends

Allah be praised, there's a whole new craze
We're gonna shoot up the foreign legion
And it's up with the sheik
And down with the frog
We're gonna liberate the region

Oh Effendi, we're gonna bury your head in the sand
Oh Effendi, you better get off my doggone land

Hey, Prince of the moonbeams
Son of the sun,
Light of a thousand stars
Your gorillas are urban
And there's bourbon on your turban
And the sun shines out of your ass

Oh Effendi, I'm gonna grovel in your wake
Oh Effendi, it's all been a big mistake

You're gonna cut out my liver
If I don't deliver
Things are getting out of hand
I'm going to ride off into the sunset and
Make a deal with the promised land

Goodbye friends
There's no more goodies in the pipeline
<E>

Where are my boys?
They are in deepest water
Where are they now?
They are over the hill and far away
But they are broken men who lie low
Waiting for miracles

Old men of rock and roll
Came bearing music
Where are they now?
They are over the hill and far away
But they're still gonna play guitars
On dead strings, and old drums
They'll play and play to pass the time
The old wild men
Old wild men
Old wild men, waiting for miracles

Lord have mercy upon the many
Lord have mercy upon the few
Lord have mercy upon the many
Lord have mercy on me and on you

People in love do funny things
Walk under buses and burn their wings
People like us do nothing right
Talk to the ceiling into the night

Look at the smile in her eyes
I knew I was right in my bones
I feel the turnin' of wheels as it grows
Look at my face in her eyes
Am I right, am I wrong
She's given me butterflies all along

Oh sitting alone in the dark
Oh feeling you close to me
We're in a dream
But the hands on the clock seem to know
Tell me it's time to go

People in love play silly games
Running in circles and everywhere
People like us can make believe
Love is forever and I'll never be

I went to a party at the local county jail;
All the cons were dancing, and the band began to wail.
But the guys were indiscreet;
They were brawling in the street.
At the local dance; at the local county jail.

Well, the band were playing,
And the booze began to flow,
But the sound came over on the police car radio,
Down at Precinct forty-nine,
Having a tear-gas of a time.
Sergeant Baker got a call from the governor of the county jail.

Load up, load up, load up with rubber bullets.
Load up, load up, load up with rubber bullets.

I love to hear those convicts squeal;
It's a shame these slugs ain't real.
But we can't have dancin' at the local county jail.

Sergeant Baker and his men made a bee-line for the jail.
And for miles around
You could hear the sirens wail/
There's a rumor goin' 'round death row
That a fuse is gonna blow;
At the local hop; at the local county jail.

Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do?

Sergeant Baker started talkin'
With a bullhorn in his hand.
He was cool; he was clear;
He was always in command.
He said "Blood will flow;
Here Padre,
Padre, you talk to your boys..."
"Trust in me,
God will come to set you free."

Well, we don't understand
Why you called in the National Guard,
When Uncle Sam is the one
Who belongs in the exercise yard.
We all got balls and brains,
But some's got balls and chains;
At the local dance; at the local county jail.

Load up, load up, load up with rubber bullets.
Load up, load up, load up with rubber bullets.

Is it really such a crime
For a guy to spend his time
At the local dance; at the local county jail?
At the local dance; at the local county jail.

Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do?

Hey toots, you put the life into living
You brought a sigh into sight
Ah hon, you make my legs turn to water
You bring the stars out at night
But they ain't half so bright
As your eyes

Gee whiz, you take the beauty out of beautiful
You play the strings of my heart
Oh babe, you take the wonder out of wonderful
Oh my, oh my, and my, if you were mine
The rain would turn to sweet sweet wine

Well he's been up all night
Breakin' his head in two to write
A little sonnet for his chickadee
But between you and me
I think it's silly. Silly

Ooh treas, you got a smile like a Rembrandt
Aha, you got the style of a queen
Oh dear, you are the petal of a rosebud
Next to you all the others could be weeds
You're the only one my garden needs

Ooh, you know the art of conversation
Must be dying
Ooh, when a romance depends on
Cliches and toupees and threepes

We're up to here with moonin' and junin'
If you want to sound sincere
Don't rely on Crosby's croonin'
Take a little time
Make up your own rhyme
Don't rely on mine
'Cause it's silly, silly, silly, silly

Down on the casting couch
A star is gonna be born
A star with the stature of a Harlow
Who's doomed
And groomed to enrapture
All her co-stars, and stuntmen, the co-stars
Oh, let there be lights, action, sound
Lights, action, sound - Roll 'em!

Out in the mezzanine
On the arm of a dumb marine
Her beauty looks out like a trailer
Norman Mailer
Waits to nail her
He's under the bed
And he's waiting for her to be dead
He's out on the patio
With his polaroid and scenario
And he's armed and he's dangerously

Close was the weather
When I was a kid
She gave me a feather from her gown
To cool me down, to cool me down
And I was the galley slave
Who lost his heart when the ship went down

Lights, action, sound
Roll 'em

I had a part in the talkies
When you were a little girl
I've taken Lassie for walkies
When she was the pup that Vaudeville threw up
And destiny lead her
Hand in paw to somewhere
In Hollywood

That's crazy, a dog up in Beverly Hills
Crazy, crazy

La, la, la, la, la (You better lie low)
<E>

Hum drum days
And a hum drum ways

Hey kids, let me tell you how I met your mom
We were dancin' and romancin' at the senior Prom
It was no infatuation
But a gradual graduation
From a boy to a man
Let me tell you while I can
The soda pop came free

Hey sis, one kiss, and I was heaven bound
Now who would have guessed Milton's paradise lost could be found
But in the eyes of the Dean, his daughter
Was doin' what she shouldn'a oughta
But a man's gotta do
What a man's gotta do
The consequence should be
Church bells, three swells
The Dean, his daughter and me

They were dating in the park
They were smooching in the dark
Of a doorway for two
She whispered "I love you
Ooh, you know I never felt this way before
Ooh, you know the elevator in my heart
Has gone awol, awol, awol, awol"
And then I kissed her
And when I kissed her
It's a wonderful world
When you're rolling in kisses

Now, the paint is peeling
(Hum drum days and hum drum ways)
Now, and when the chips are down
(Hum drum days and hum drum ways)
Now, you kinda lose all feeling
(Hum drum days and hum drum ways)
Now, your head goes round and round
(Hum drum days and hum drum ways)
Round and round and round and round and round
I'm throwing myself off this train

Hum drum days
And a hum drum ways

Hum drum days, he's got
Hum drum ways, oh boy

Hey, you know I'm really earning now
My ship came in with a cargo of dollars
My name's lit up on the prow
It's a wonderful world
When you're rolling in dollars
Now!
<E>

Co-starring you
And co-starring me
Starring us both together
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Forever and ever and ever
A back lot romance
A scripted affair
The screenplay a blessing from heaven
We're gone with the wind
On the Orient Express
To join the Magnificent Seven

The film of my love
Will travel the world
And travel the whole world over
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Over and over and over
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Over and over and over
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over

A close-up of yours
A long shot of mine
Superimposed together
I'll zoom in on you
With a love that is true
In cinema-scope forever

A clapper board kiss
There's an Oscar in this
A hit or a miss whatever
A box office wedding
A premier for two
We'll be on location forever

When Pathe recall
The thrill of it all
They'll edit us both together
A legend a classic
An epic of love
Captured on film forever
A lasting embrace
That time can't erase
Let them censor the wind
Or the weather
The film of my love
Will conquer the world
Forever and ever and ever

The film of my love
Will travel the world
And travel the whole world over
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Over and over and over
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Over and over and over
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over
Over and over and over

Another fish head in the dustbin
Another loser in the queue for the soup kitchen
Another reason for a visit
We think you'd better come down

Another nigger on the woodpile
Another honky on the dole
Another trip from off the 15th floor
The greatest story ever told
Was so wrong, so wrong

'Cause you promised milk and honey
With an everlasting life
And we listened with our ears closed
And a blindness in our eyes
But we heard them as they nailed you
And we saw you crucified

The second coming of the Holy Ghost
We need a pocketful of miracles
Two thousand years and he ain't shown yet
We kept his seat warm and the table set
The second sitting for the Last Supper

Another Guru in the money
Another mantra in the mail
An easy way from rags to riches
God's little acre's up for sale

The time is right for resurrection
We think you'd better come down
The church don't ring with hallelujahs
You haven't been for so long
So long, so long

Two thousand years and he ain't shown yet
We kept his seat warm and the table set
The second sitting for the Last Supper

Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river
Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea,
You lay your bets and then you pay the price
The things we do for love, the things we do for love.

Communication is the problem to the answer
You've got her number and your hand is on the phone
The weather's turned and all the lines are down
The things we do for love, the things we do for love.

Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes.
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up.

Ooh you made me love you
Ooh you've got a way
Ooh you had me crawling up the wall.

Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go

You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up.

Ooh you made me love you
Ooh you've got a way
Ooh you had me crawling up the wall.

A compromise would surely help the situation
Agree to disagree but disagree to part
When after all it's just a compromise of
The things we do for love, the things we do for love

Do the Wall Street shuffle
Hear the money rustle
Watch the greenbacks tumble
Feel the Sterling crumble

You need a yen to make a mark
If you want to make money
You need the luck to make a buck
If you want to be Getty, Rothschild
You've gotta be cool on Wall Street

You've gotta be cool on Wall Street
When your index is low
Dow Jones ain't got time for the bums
They wind up on skid row with holes in their pockets
They plead with you, buddy can you spare the dime
But you ain't got the time
Doin' the
Doin' the

Oh, Howard Hughes
Did your money make you better?
Are you waiting for the hour
When you can screw me?
'Cause you're big enough

To do the Wall Street Shuffle
Let your money hustle
Bet you'd sell your mother
You can buy another

Doin' the
Doin' the

You buy and sell
You wheel and deal
But you're living on instinct
You get a tip
You follow it
And you make a big killing

On Wall Street

It's one thing to know it but another to admit
We're the worst band in the world
But we don't give a

If Garbo played guitar with Valentino on the drums
Then we'd be nothing more than a bunch of darma bums
So tune up, tune up

Well we've never done a days work in our life
And our records sell in zillions
It irrigates my heart with greed
To know that you adore me
Up yours, up mine
But up everybody's that takes time
But we're working on it
Working on it (Ooh)

We never seen the van - leave it to the roadies
Never met the roadies - leave them in the van
All because of circumstances way beyond control
We became the darlings of this thing called rock and roll, ooh

Here I am a record on a jukebox
A little piece of plastic with a hole, ooh
Play me
Buy me and you play me then my plastic turns to gold

Here we are together on your hi-fi
A little piece of plastic with a hole, oh
Fade me, fade me, fade me, fade me

Your nose is runnin'
And your eyes are red
Your head is achin'
You'd be better in bed
From the bottom of your fever
To the throbbing in your toes
You've got a cold
You've got a cold

You're searching madly
To find a cure
But the mercury's rising
To a hundred and four
You've got a beauty, a bad ass
The mother of them all
You've got a cold
You've got a cold

Ain't no use in fightin' it
Get into bed and try to sweat it out

Hot toddies won't help you
Warm blankets won't sweat it out
Inhalants just choke you
Hot flushes will tell you
Anyway you've got it
Ain't no doubt about it
Nothin' new about
You can scream and shout it

Hot toddies won't help you
Warm blankets won't sweat it out
Inhalants just choke you
Hot flushes will tell you
Anyway you've got it
Ain't no doubt about it
Nothin' new about
You can't fight it

Foreign bodies in your Kleenex
You've got no taste at all
While your system is dyin'
The bugs are havin' a ball
You've got a beauty, a bad ass
The mother of them all
You've got a cold
You've got a cold

Money can't be beat Oh no
When you get down, down to the root
Don't give a damn don't give a hoot
Still gotta keep makin the loot
Chauffeur driven
Gotta make her quick as you can
Give her lovin' make you a man
Get her in the palm of your hand
Bread from Heaven
Gimme a country
Where I can be free
Don't need the unions
Strangling me
Keep me in exile the rest of my days
Burn me in hell but as long as it pays

Bus stop, wet day
She's there, I say
Please share my umbrella

Bus stops, bus goes
She stays, love grows
Under my umbrella

All that summer we enjoyed it
Wind and rain and shine
That umbrella we employed it
By August she was mine

Every morning I would see her
Waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shop
And she would show me what she'd bought

Other people stared
As if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers
Are going to be the same

That's the way the whole thing started
Silly but it's true
Thinking of our sweet romance
Beginning in a dew

Came the sun
The ice was melting
No more sheltering now
Nice to think that that umbrella
Led me to avow

Every morning I would see her

I was walkin' down the street
Concentratin' on truckin' right
I heard a dark voice beside of me
And I looked 'round in a state of fright
I saw four faces, one mad, a brother from the gutter
They looked me up and down a bit and turned to each other

I say, I don't like cricket, oh no, I love it
I don't like cricket, oh no, I love it
Don't you walk through my words
You got to show some respect
Don't you walk through my words
Cause you ain't heard me out yet

Well, he looked down on my silver chain
He said: I'll give you one dollar
I said: You've got to be jokin, man
It was a present from me mother
He said: I like it, I want it, I'll take it off your hands
And you'll be sorry you crossed me
You better understand that you're alone (a long way from home)

And I say, I don't like reggae, oh no, I love it
I don't like reggae, I love it
Don't you cramp me style
Don't you queer me pitch
Don't you walk through my words
Cause you ain't heard me out yet

I hurried back to the swimming pool, sinkin' pina colada
I heard a dark voice beside me say
Would you like something harder?
She said: I've got it, you want it
My harvest is the best, and if you try it
You'll like it and wallow in a dreadlock holiday

And I say, don't like Jamaica, oh no, I love her
Don't like Jamaica, oh no, I love her
Don't you walk through my words
You got to show some respect
Don't you walk through my words
Cause you ain't heard me out yet
I don't like cricket, oh no, I love it (Dreadlock holiday)
I don't like Reggae, oh no, I love it (Dreadlock holiday)
I don't like Jamaica, oh no, I love her (Dreadlock holiday)

Double takes I will excite,
Make you dream of me at night

Well good morning Judge, how are you today
I'm in trouble, please put me away
A pretty thing took a shine to me
I couldn't stop her, so I let it be

I couldn't stop her, so I let it be
I couldn't stop her, so I let it be
I couldn't stop her, so I let it be

He didn't do it, he wasn't there
He didn't want it, he wouldn't dare

Well good morning Judge, yes I'm back again
I'm in trouble, so it's back to the pen
I found a car, but I couldn't pay
I fell in love, and I drove it away

I fell in love, and I drove it away
I fell in love, and I drove it away
I fell in love, and I drove it away

He didn't do it, he wasn't there
He didn't want it, he wouldn't dare
I didn't do it, I wasn't there
I didn't want it, I wouldn't dare

Alcatraz is like a home sweet home
I'm so wanted, and I'm never alone
San Quentin is the place to be
I'm so happy, I don't want to be free

So happy I don't want to be free
So happy I don't want to be free
So happy I don't want to be free

Just like a rollin' stone
I'm outside lookin' in
But if your chance came would you take it
Where on earth do I begin
I'm Mandy fly me

I've often heard her jingle
It's never struck a chord
With a smile as bright as sunshine
She called me through the poster
And welcomed me aboard
She led me she fed me
She read me like a book
But I'm hiding in the small print
Won't you take another look
And take me away
Try me Mandy fly me away

The world was spinning like a ball
And then it wasn't there at all
And as my heart began to fall

I saw her walking on the water
As the sharks were comin' for me
I felt Mandy pull me up give me the kiss of life
Just like the girl in Dr. No No No No

Ah when they pulled me from the wreckage
And her body couldn't be found
Was it in my mind it seems
I had a crazy dream
I told them so but they said no no no no

I found me on a street
And starin' at a wall
If it hadn't have been for Mandy
Her promise up above me
Well I wouldn't be here at all
So if you're travellin' in the sky
Don't be surprised if someone said Hi
I'm Mandy fly me

Sergeant Baker got a call from the governor of the county jail.

Load up, load up, load up with rubber bullets.
Load up, load up, load up with rubber bullets.

I love to hear those convicts squeal;
It's a shame these slugs ain't real.
But we can't have dancin' at the local county jail.

Sergeant Baker and his men made a bee-line for the jail.
And for miles around
You could hear the sirens wail/
There's a rumor goin' 'round death row
That a fuse is gonna blow;
At the local hop; at the local county jail.

Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do?

Sergeant Baker started talkin'
With a bullhorn in his hand.
He was cool; he was clear;
He was always in command.
He said "Blood will flow;
Here Padre,
Padre, you talk to your boys..."
"Trust in me,
God will come to set you free."

Well, we don't understand
Why you called in the National Guard,
When Uncle Sam is the one
Who belongs in the exercise yard.
We all got balls and brains,
But some's got balls and chains;
At the local dance; at the local county jail.

Load up, load up, load up with rubber bullets.
Load up, load up, load up with rubber bullets.

Is it really such a crime
For a guy to spend his time
At the local dance; at the local county jail?
At the local dance; at the local county jail.

Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do?

Hey toots, you put the life into living
You brought a sigh into sight
Ah hon, you make my legs turn to water
You bring the stars out at night
But they ain't half so bright
As your eyes

Gee whiz, you take the beauty out of beautiful
You play the strings of my heart
Oh babe, you take the wonder out of wonderful
Oh my, oh my, and my, if you were mine
The rain would turn to sweet sweet wine

Well he's been up all night
Breakin' his head in two to write
A little sonnet for his chickadee
But between you and me
I think it's silly. Silly

Ooh treas, you got a smile like a Rembrandt
Aha, you got the style of a queen
Oh dear, you are the petal of a rosebud
Next to you all the others could be weeds
You're the only one my garden needs

Ooh, you know the art of conversation
Must be dying
Ooh, when a romance depends on
Cliches and toupees and threepes

We're up to here with moonin' and junin'
If you want to sound sincere
Don't rely on Crosby's croonin'
Take a little time
Make up your own rhyme
Don't rely on mine
'Cause it's silly, silly, silly, silly

Hum drum days
And a hum drum ways

Hey kids, let me tell you how I met your mom
We were dancin' and romancin' at the senior Prom
It was no infatuation
But a gradual graduation
From a boy to a man
Let me tell you while I can
The soda pop came free

Hey sis, one kiss, and I was heaven bound
Now who would have guessed Milton's paradise lost could be found
But in the eyes of the Dean, his daughter
Was doin' what she shouldn'a oughta
But a man's gotta do
What a man's gotta do
The consequence should be
Church bells, three swells
The Dean, his daughter and me

They were dating in the park
They were smooching in the dark
Of a doorway for two
She whispered "I love you
Ooh, you know I never felt this way before
Ooh, you know the elevator in my heart
Has gone awol, awol, awol, awol"
And then I kissed her
And when I kissed her
It's a wonderful world
When you're rolling in kisses

Now, the paint is peeling
(Hum drum days and hum drum ways)
Now, and when the chips are down
(Hum drum days and hum drum ways)
Now, you kinda lose all feeling
(Hum drum days and hum drum ways)
Now, your head goes round and round
(Hum drum days and hum drum ways)
Round and round and round and round and round
I'm throwing myself off this train

Hum drum days
And a hum drum ways

Hum drum days, he's got
Hum drum ways, oh boy

Hey, you know I'm really earning now
My ship came in with a cargo of dollars
My name's lit up on the prow
It's a wonderful world
When you're rolling in dollars
Now!
<E>
<S>
Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river
Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea,
You lay your bets and then you pay the price
The things we do for love, the things we do for love.

Communication is the problem to the answer
You've got her number and your hand is on the phone
The weather's turned and all the lines are down
The things we do for love, the things we do for love.

Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes.
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up.

Ooh you made me love you
Ooh you've got a way
Ooh you had me crawling up the wall.

Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes.
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up.

Ooh you made me love you
Ooh you've got a way
Ooh you had me crawling up the wall.

A compromise would surely help the situation
Agree to disagree but disagree to part
When after all it's just a compromise of
The things we do for love, the things we do for love

Do the Wall Street shuffle
Hear the money rustle
Watch the greenbacks tumble
Feel the Sterling crumble

You need a yen to make a mark
If you want to make money
You need the luck to make a buck
If you want to be Getty, Rothschild
You've gotta be cool on Wall Street

You've gotta be cool on Wall Street
When your index is low
Dow Jones ain't got time for the bums
They wind up on skid row with holes in their pockets
They plead with you, buddy can you spare the dime
But you ain't got the time
Doin' the
Doin' the

Oh, Howard Hughes
Did your money make you better?
Are you waiting for the hour
When you can screw me?
'Cause you're big enough

To do the Wall Street Shuffle
Let your money hustle
Bet you'd sell your mother
You can buy another

Doin' the
Doin' the

You buy and sell
You wheel and deal
But you're living on instinct
You get a tip
You follow it
And you make a big killing

On Wall Street

You don't know how to ease my pain
You don't know
You don't know how to ease my pain
You don't know what the sound is darlin'
It's the sound of my tears fallin'
Or is it the rain?
You don't know how to play the game
You cheat
You lie
You make me wanna cry
You make me wanna cry
Cry...
You make me wanna cry
You don't know how to ease my pain
You don't know
You don't know how to ease my pain
Don't you hear any voices cryin'?
That's the sound of my love dyin'
Here comes the rain
You don't know how to play the game
You cheat
You lie
You don't even know how to say goodbye
You make me wanna cry
You don't know
You don't even know how to say goodbye
You make me wanna cry
You don't even know how to say goodbye
You make me wanna cry

Casted out
I'm watching your eyes
Casting out
My visions of nine
Blacking out
Casted out I'm watching
Your eyes bleed dry

Touch with frustrated lips
Love is like starting over
With every step
Engraving the problems of memories

Casted out
I'm watching your eyes
Casting out
My visions of nine
Blacking out
Casted out
I'm watching
Your eyes bleed dry

Drunks on failures regrets
Letters of silence confess
Burdens within
Speaking as loneliness listens
While hopelessly feeling

Casted out
I'm watching your eyes
Casting out
My visions of nine
Blacking out
Casted out
I'm watching
Your eyes bleed dry

There's a definite pattern
To our behavior
Somehow the end draws us closer

Casting out
My visions of nine
Casted out
Let ten die with time
Blacking out
Casted out
I'm watching your eyes bleed dry

Blacking out
Cast it out

Sky cities scrape
The lining of heaven
Beneath this vast region
Manifest destination
Leaves us fast erasing

Days pass
Time flies
You don't realize
Today you waste

This dying youth
Of beauty and pleasure
Evaporates
Lives are connected
To lasting obsessions
That become possessions of waste
While buying the next
New fashion that's fed
To enslave this land of the free

Days pass
Time flies
You don't realize
Today you waste

Days pass
Time flies
You don't realize
Today you waste

Don't be so surprised [Repeats]

Days pass
Time flies
You don't realize
Today you waste
<E>
<S>
I felt you cut free
Turning cold shoulders to me
Growing blame lines
Communicating lies
Nothing more to trust
Fallacies of love
Killing all that holds you

Bring me back to this
What you said useless
Leave me (leave me)
I'll shed my skin these scars will mend

Don't worry about me
The heart is supposed to bleed
Purity is drained
Help each other die
I see it
I see it in your eyes
Killing all that holds you

Bring me back to this
What you said useless
Leave me (leave me)
I'll shed my skin these scars will mend

Eyes twitch and lies itch of nervous
Eyes twitch and lies itch from a nervous ending
Innocence is ugly in the one who is guilty

Bring me back to this
What you said useless
Leave me (leave me)
I'll shed my skin these scars will mend

Styling your shroud
Infecting the crowd
Steady letting the fruit of her thrill
Fool you so well

Fictitious styles of living
We've expected to work
But this is all your giving
Half of what your worth
Pigeon hold in battles
Overtones of snow in her clutch
Falling through lines
One more breath destroys
The best of you
The death of you

Styling your shroud
Infecting the crowd
Steady letting the fruit of her thrill
Fool you so well

A precious gift embedded
Deep within your skin
But parasitic pleasures
Are closer than kin
Please expose your shadows
Such concerns are products of love
Falling in lies
One more fraud destroys
Our trust in you
Our love for you

Styling your shroud
Infecting the crowd
Steady letting the fruit of her thrill
Fool you so well

As you kiss the abstract
And pray it's everything you'd hoped for
The smell of her, the thrill of her
The fruit of her, the use of her
Is killing everything that you've worked for

The smell of her, the thrill of her
The fruit of her, the use of her
Is killing everything that you've worked for

Styling your shroud
Infecting the crowd
Steady letting the fruit of her thrill
Fool you so well

Smell of her
Thrill of her
Fruit of her
Use of her
Smell of her
Thrill of her
Fruit of her
Use of her
Smell of her
Thrill of her
Fruit of her
Use of her
The smell of her
Thrill of her
Fruit of her

Hindered by innocence
The timid turn to prey
Swallowed in her smile
Unaware
Turning ears deaf to pain
Willing and weak are one in the same
Watch as your rapid seasons start to change
All of the seasons that fought you
All of the reasons that got you here in the first place

Love in time grows stagnant
The innocence we have lost
New grains of time will not rewind

Injuries strain from her perfect art of guile
Swindling her space
In despair
Shed a tear of mock sincerity
Condescending hearts can display
Cracks as your zone of comfort starts to fray
Humbling to sit back and watch through
All of the actions that got you
Clearly no mercy

Love in time grows stagnant
The innocence we have lost
New grains of time will not rewind

Through patience I'm viewing from outside
Such a shame your pride
Left you in a state of pure denial

Love in time grows stagnant
The innocence we have lost
New grains of time will not rewind
<E>
<S>
The death of a king
Alluring lassos
Slide on so smooth
Tension made of razors
Dragging across you
The flushing of eyes
Couldn't cleanse your abrasions
Deep inside consumed with guilt
I'm clothed in a bed of blankets
Dream suspicious strangers over night

[Chorus]
Righteous pharisees befriending
Silent movements mar re injuring god
The taste of absent minded actions
Outweigh forgiveness

Bridging a widow in spite of her venom
I've failed to mention your soul
Three becoming two
Such a left in criminal
Only the mind of the temptress knows
Actions are my remorse for amnesia

[Chorus]

So close to healing the weak
Turning into the enemy
Paralyzing kings

We are so self

[Chorus]
<E>
<S>
One at a time
One in the same
One is the time
That remains
Snip back the weak
Before they give away
I'm twisted in knots from
Hard work and strain

I've been waiting so long for this time
I'm terrified
Blind in ways I've never realized
I don't mind

All at a time
All in the same
Califormula
I've become prey
Strolling down
In my face
These tears I'm not crying
This will not kill me

I've been waiting so long for this time
I'm terrified
Blind in ways I've never realized
I don't mind

To do this right
We must realize
Everyone kneads equally

I've been waiting so long for this time
I'm terrified
Blind in ways I've never realized
I don't mind
<E>
<S>
How small do you
Want me to be
Weighed in the balance
Left lonely
So much can be
Said through silence
As hard as it seems
All that we need
Is too close to be seen

Our lives
You build your walls for me to climb
A billion walls for me to climb
You build your walls for me to climb

Travels the very
Nature we'll live in
Seasons to cycles
Children to men
Mislead and misread
Company or companion
With all of our hearts
We follow our dreams
Slightly out of reach

Our lives
You build your walls for me to climb
A billion walls for me to climb
You build your walls for me to climb

Casting a cool breeze
Supplied by the autumn
Question where it went wrong
Climbing Jacob's ladder
Climbing Jacob's ladder
Kindly could you re-evaluate
Autumn's animated growth

Autumn indicates the death of
Beauty as we know
Autumn indicates the death of
Beauty as we know
Keep on fighting
One died from
Burning at his throat
Autumn swiftly
Stole the breath of body, mind, and soul

Try and come to willingly embrace
Karma's kiss of withering decay
Death feeds, hell breeds
Subside in the autumn

Autumn indicates the death of
Beauty as we know
Autumn indicates the death of
Beauty as we know
Keep on fighting
One died from
Burning at his throat
Autumn swiftly
Stole the breath of body, mind, and-

Lives swallow the infatuation
Cleverly seduced
Evil's in the stink of you
Rise and fall
We decompose

Rest against the sore
Push breath and pull
Ripping out compassion
Instincts adapting
Sin sings a moan
In slides night
Unite and spread the heart apart
And smile of pain

I can't show
My true embrace
Now that you're subdued
I begin to weaken you
Rise and fall
We decompose

Prey on the masses
Conscience relapses
The less we think
And more we drink
Our actions are casual
While sin sings a moan

Lives swallow the infatuation
Cleverly seduced
Evil's in the stink of you
Rise and fall
We decompose

Distance is safer than trust
Honestly honesty's a fable in love
Calloused
Shedding skin I start to grin as malice
Becomes my fuel

I can't show
My true embrace
Now that you're subdued
I begin to weaken you
Rise and fall
We decompose

Shedding skin I start to grin as malice
Becomes my fuel

Cherish
Two circular views of
Blue with a gray shade
So captivating
More than you know

False perceptions
That brought forth these questions
Of truth, love, and hope
Now that you're injuring
I carry you with me
Just please hold on

Disappear and dissolve
A weakening wall
Will one day fall
It's wise to
Sever our loss
A redefine pulse
Through the iris

Love's not all lost
But it's nailed to my cross
And crucified all that I've held on
To be awaiting
Anticipating a touch such as yours

False affection
A spawn of neglecting
A love, lust, hoax
Please understand me
That now where you're standing
Is closer then I'd hoped

Disappear and dissolve
A weakening wall
Will one day fall
It's wise to
Sever our loss
A redefine pulse
Through the iris

Your iris
Your iris

Disappear and dissolve
A weakening wall
Will one day fall
It's wise to
Sever our loss
A redefine pulse
Through the iris

Disappear and dissolve
A weakening wall
Will one day fall
It's wise to
Sever our loss
A redefine pulse
A new iris

Distance and space
Allow emotions to age
Into faith
Our bodies may end up alone but close

[Chorus]
Are you there
Can you hear me
Are you there
Can you feel me

Just in the way
All your fingertips touch me
They are healing
One day we'll all fall prey

[Chorus]

Waking up
Good morning to you my dear
I'm waking up
Enduring my biggest fears of
Distance away (a weight)
Distance away

[Chorus]

Waking up
Good morning to you my dear
I'm waking up
Enduring my biggest fear love

Change my attempt good intentions
Crouched over
You were not there
Living in fear
But signs were not really that scarce
Obvious tears
But I will not
Hide you through this I want you to help
And please see
The bleeding heart perched on my shirt
Die, withdraw
Hide in cold sweat
Quivering lips
Ignore remorse
Naming a kid, living wasteland
This time you've tried
All that you can turning you red
Change my attempt good intentions
Should I, could I
Here we are with your obsession
Should I, could I
Crowned hopeless
The article read living wasteland
This time you've tried
All that you can turning you red but I will not
Hide you through this
I want you to help
Change my attempt good intentions
Should I, could I
Here we are with your obsession
Should I, could I
Heave the silver hollow sliver
Piercing through another victim
Turn and tremble be judgmental
Ignorant to all the symbols
Blind the face with beauty paste
Eventually you'll one day know
Change my attempt good intentions
Limbs tied, skin tight
Self inflicted his perdition
Should I, could I
Change my attempt good intentions
Should I, could I
Should I, could I

Please savior of here
Give me shelter from fear
I need answers to this
Crazy world that's so mixed
With this pain that leaves us
Lifeless and so dead-souled
We all need to break this mold

I'm so sure, you'll blame me for this all
What's so wrong, you claim to call this love
I'm so sure, you'll blame me for this all
What's so wrong, you claim to call this love

Drips hit the floor, who cares at all
Flesh sheared and torn, sleaves hide remorse
Stardom branded skin, traps pain within
Expectations, never reaching

I'm so sure, you'll blame me for this all
What's so wrong, you claim to call this love
I'm so sure, you'll blame me for this all
What's so wrong, you claim to call this love

I can't seem to change you or open up your eye's
So go on and sing your sad, sad song.
I don't even blame you the routine is nice.
Nine to five and a suit and tie.
Fear of failure in comfort zones kill

[Chorus]
Brace your self and give into the moment.
You've got nothing to lose.
So what is your excuse?
Save yourself your dying in slow motion.
You got nothing to lose.
So what's your excuse?

Life can't seem to teach you the safe card is right.
So stray from the fight.
Don't you realize?
The daydreamers nightmare is to never even try.
Your time has slipped by.
Fear of failure in comfort zones kill

[Chorus]

Take a step back and find a way out of here.
Can't you see the answer is loud and clear.

[Chorus]

Find a way out of here...

Wait
The fact you did it
But don't admit it
Won't make you innocent

Fate
Will find you wicked
And turns you victim
For everything you have done
So justify the reason to kill

Reason to kill
I bet you will
You're fooling no one but yourself
But yourself
I wish you well
Oh what tangled webs we weave
When we practice to deceive
I know you well
I know you well

Actions and Motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out
Hell has to notice
Your Actions and Motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out

I just get it
How you manage
To justify who dies
Like judge and jury
You're the very
One who crucifies
Don't get your hands dirty to kill
Dirty to kill
Use someone else
Know all your lies are measured in hell

Measured in hell
I wish you well
Oh what tangled webs we weave
When we practice to deceive
I know you well
I know you well

Actions and Motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out
Hell has to notice
Your Actions and Motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out

Actions and Motives
Bear the cross

You would kill your king for the right prize
Oil and water thicker then blood
Oh I know your type

Use us to get what you wanted
You cant finish what you started
I find it kinda funny how you try
To rectify the damage

You're failure to find compromise
Walls are coming down
Will you survive sacrifice
Or tumble to the ground

Your lying to yourself
And to everyone that
Knows your name
You play the part of
The fool so well
Oh I know your type

Use us to get what you wanted
You cant finish what you've started
I find it kind of funny how you try

Pay attention, pay attention, pay attention please
He who lusts through life for excess of this world
Dies a lonely man, careless of his soul
Throwing caution to the wind with foolish ignorance
You're full of pride (full of pride) full of pride
And in arrogance you can't accept the nearing end of this short lived life

Smile and give a toast, brag and boast
Fool the world with all of your lies
The parasite's host never even knows
Pull the wool over our eyes

Walk the line and pay the price
A pound of flesh for paradise
Wear the wounds of your demise

Fail to mention your intentions, fail to mention why
The actions of your life contradict your words
The path in which you walk is a vice of no remorse
Washing conscience from the skin, claiming innocence
Ignore the signs

Smile and give a toast, brag and boast
Fool the world with all of your lies
The parasite's host never even knows
Pull the wool over our eyes

Walk the line and pay the price
A pound of flesh for paradise
Wear the wounds of your demise

A pound of flesh for paradise

I should have made your mind up for you (for you)
I should have made your mind up for you (for you)

Walk the line and pay the price
A pound of flesh for paradise
Wear the wounds of your demise

From cradle to grave, you chose to trade
A pound of flesh for paradise
Wear the wounds of your demise.

Beauty over wisdom to fit in with their style
Your Cinderella story's for a price
Vanity's a business built to fleece the unique
Silicon and stars collide, the rest will fall in line

Just as beautiful as you are
It's so pitiful what you are
You should have seen this coming all along

Visually you're stimulating to my eyes
Your Cinderella syndrome's full of lies
Your insecurities are concealed by your pride
Pretty soon your ego will kill what's left inside

Just as beautiful as you are
It's so pitiful what you are
You should have seen this coming all along
It's so pitiful what you are
As beautiful as you are
You should have seen this coming all along

You're everything that's so typical
Maybe you're alone for a reason, you're the reason

It's so pitiful what you are, you should have seen this coming all along

Just as beautiful as you are
It's so pitiful what you are
You should have seen this coming all along
It's so pitiful what you are
As beautiful as you are

Faith, fact or fiction, now what is the difference?
We're all just searching for the lie
Dividing nations from confrontations
Haven't you seen that the blind lead the blind?

We're a moment in time
In the cycle of life
We're just a moment in time
In the cycle of life

Without dedication there's self medication
We're all just searching for the lie
Communication was lost in translation
Haven't you seen that the blind lead the blind?

We're a moment in time
In the cycle of life
We're just a moment in time
In the cycle of life

The life that we are all part of)

On imitation.

So what is your drug of choice.
Pick your poison and enjoy.

Disasterpation the thrill of a nation.
Temptation is for sale.
Disasterpation the death of a nation.
Money collect yourself.

Temptation is for sale.
Disasterpation the death of a nation.

Deep under the surface I keep the love.
Older and aware of a hidden universe.
I pray to be young and pray to be inspired.
Words of your tongue blister like fire.

I can't let you go.
Slow down don't leave.
Dying days of my youth.
Over take me.

There is a glimpse of death in your eye's.
I'm not prepared to let out those cries.
I plead to stay young soon will be expired.
So lost in denial.

I can't let you go.
Slow down don't leave.
Dying days of my youth.
Over take me.

Reach in her womb shelter from strived.
Baring the gifts, burdens of life.
I pray to stay young but soon will be expired.
The age of innocence long sense gone.

I can't let you go.
Slow down don't leave.
Dying days of my youth.
Over take me.

Fools who for looking back word.
Chose to live as statues frozen fracture.
Youthful laughter.
<E>
<S>
Digging deeper in my mind, can't get you out of my head
There's no way to describe, just how you make me feel
I don't know is it love, I have lost control
Even when I'm gone, I can't get away

I can't focus, when I'm near you
Do you notice, me at all?
I can't focus, when I hear you
Do you notice, that I can't focus?

Like the moth flies to the light, catch it at first sight
I can't deny, I'm taken by the beauty in your eye's
I don't know is it love, I have lost control
Even when I'm gone, I can't get away

I can't focus, when I'm near you
Do you notice, me at all?
I can't focus, when I hear you
Do you notice, that I can't focus?

I can't focus, when I'm near you
Do you notice, me at all?
I can't focus, when I hear you
Do you notice?
Do you notice?

I can't focus, when I'm near you
Do you notice, me at all?
I can't focus, when I hear you
Do you notice, that I can't focus?

Hindered by innocence
The timid turn to prey
Swallowed in her smile
Unaware
Turning ears
Deaf to pain
Willing and weak
Are one in the same
Watch as your rapid
Seasons start to change
All of the seasons that fought you
All of the reasons that got you
Here in the first place

Love in time grows stagnant
The innocence we have lost
New grains of time will not rewind

Injuries strain from
Her perfect art of guile
Swindling her space
In despair
Shed a tear
Of mock sincerity
Condescending hearts can display
Cracks as your zone of
Comfort starts to fray
Humbling to sit back and watch
Through all of the actions that got you
Clearly no mercy

Love in time grows stagnant
The innocence we have lost
New grains of time will not rewind

Through patience I'm viewing from outside
Such a shame your pride
Left you in a state of pure denial

Love in time grows stagnant
The innocence we have lost
New grains of time will not rewind
<E>
<S>
You and I
Share the same reflection
Why don't
You see
That we cannot
Survive in this condition
If you're cut
I'll bleed
So go on
Carve into
Your own heart
I could use
A new scar
Or a brand new start
Slowly
Severing
The only
Memories
That bind us
As one

[Chorus]
I just don't know
How to win (how to win)
With you
And I can't let go
Part of me (part of me)
Is you

We have lost
All communication
When words fall
On deaf ears
I'm starting to
Feel a transformation
How did I get here
I don't
Recognize
My own reflection
It's a ghost of
What once was
Gone from
Relative
To stranger
Separating
Body
From mind

[Chorus]

You stay the same
I'll remain to change

[Chorus]

I just don't know
Just don't know
Just don't know

I can't let go
Can't let go
Can't let go
<E>

[Verse 1]
Dreamscapes and Fantasies
Evolve into reality when passion is pursued
The passion turns professional and kills the mood
Finding symmetry, so hard to achieve
Inspiration loves misery, blue skies are turning grey
Let it rain, let it rain...

[Chorus]
So long, I've been waiting
Patiently you're not all alone
So lost, I've been searching
Patiently we're not all alone

[Verse 2]
Routine rituals
Physically, mentally, pressure's made for tea
Remember to appreciate the bittersweet.
Finding symmetry, so hard to achieve
Expectations test abilities, life is but a dream
And I sleep, let us see...

[Chorus]
So long, I've been waiting
Patiently you're not all alone
So lost, I've been searching
Patiently we're not all alone

In your eye's is the picture perfect.
In your eye's does the grass look greener.
Have you seen it though my eye's.

The world has caught on fire from what I've been told.
These city lights are killing ever slowly.
The sanity with in me.
Maybe I lost in my creation.
This isn't how I thought I turn out.

[Chorus 1]
In your eye's I'm picture perfect.
In your eye's the grass is greener.
Have you seen it though my eye's.
Cause through my eye's.

Stars are burning brighter.
So bright we can't ignore.
We're hypnotized drive-by's, train wrecks tragedy are patient.
Maybe I a product of my placement.
Given no doubt to make up our minds.

[Chorus 1]

In your eye's I'm so picture perfect.
In your eye's the grass is greener.
Have you seen it though my eye's.
Through my eye's.
Through my eye's.
Through my eye's.

[Chorus 2]
Pay attention please.
He who lusts through life for excess in this world.
Dies a lonely man, careless of his soul.
Throwing caution to the wind with foolish ignorance.
You're full of pride.
And in arrogance you can't accept the nearing end of this short lived life.

Smile and give a toast, brag and boast.
Fool the world with all of your lies.
The parasite's host never even knows.
Pull the wool over our eyes.

Walk the line and pay the price.
A pound of flesh for paradise.
Wear the wounds of your demise.

Fail to mention your intentions, fail to mention why.
The actions of your life contradict your words...
The path in which you walk is a vice of no remorse.
Washing conscience from the skin, claiming innocence.
Ignore the signs.

From cradle to grave, you chose to trade.
A pound of flesh for paradise.
Wear the wounds of your demise.

[Chorus 2]

Smile and give a toast, brag and boast.
Fool the world with all of your lies.
The parasite's host never even knows.
Pull the wool over our eyes.

From cradle to grave, you chose to trade.
A pound of flesh for paradise.
Wear the wounds of your demise.
<E>
<S>
Shadows set the mood.
Innocence left the room.
And all I know to do is shed a tear for you.

Oh oh
Oh oh

[Chorus]
Please don't be ashamed, whether you win or lose.
I just want to tell you that I'm proud of you.
Don't be afraid, when your fight is through.
I just need you to know that I'm here with you.

I can't watch you choose to pour salts in your wounds.
Now all I know to do, is say a prayer for you.

Oh oh
Oh oh

[Chorus]

Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
<E>
<S>
It's Russian roulette
With no luck
You can kiss it good-bye
There's no such thing as sympathy
When the disease is entering
At first glance your instinct says
This stranger is a little dangerous
The cat was killed from curious thrills
Now Christ has left the manger

The taste is so divine (So divine)
A chemical coma life (coma life)
Welcome to your vice
Good luck with life
Cause you can't, you can't, you can't
Kill me that easily

It's so nice to meet you
It's so nice to know you
Now that your guards down
Let me show you
Superior rights from initial highs
Have now come back to haunt you
Your cravings beg
The stranger's hands for a taste that's so familiar

The taste is so divine (So divine)
A chemical coma life (coma life)

Welcome to your vice
Good luck with life
Cause you can't, you can't, you can't
Kill me that easily

What will you decide?
When you're out of time
Cause you can't, you can't, you can't
Kill me that easily

The battle you picked was so one sided
Now to pin it on me
The one you invited
Beg, plead, scream
For redemption, for forgiveness
Beg, plead, scream
Sorry I'm not listening

Welcome to your vice
Good luck with life
Cause you can't, you can't, you can't
Kill me that easily

What will you decide?
When you?re out of time
Cause you can't, you can't, you can't
Kill me that easily
<E>
<S>
How long will you scream at the walls...
For someone to listen?
Surrender the right to resolve
Cause no one will listen

Confusion sets in
With no beginning or end
Frozen in place
The scenery's unraveling

Hanging on by a thread
The child is screaming
While holding his breath
Hanging on by a thread
The child is screaming
While holding his breath

How long will you scream at the walls...
For someone to listen?
Surrender the right to resolve
Cause no one will listen

Forever you face
The fear of being erased
No need to speak
They'll pass you by and wonder why

You're hanging on by a thread
You throw away everything
From holding your breath

How long will you scream at the walls...
For someone to listen?
Surrender the right to resolve
Cause no one will listen

Biting your tongue
The top of your lungs
Biting
Biting
Biting your tongue

How long will you scream at the walls...
For someone to listen?
Surrender the right to resolve
Cause no one will listen
<E>
<S>
Keep changing your mind
Like clouds in the sky
Love me when you're high
Leave me when you cry

I know it all
It takes time
Like a river running dry
When the sun's too bright

So long, this is goodbye
May we meet again in another life
Like strangers passing by
May we see it clearly in a different light

Keep touching lies
Like a thief in the night
The sun will rise
And expose all the lies

So why deny that you and I
Live different lives
The rivers from your eyes
Can't change my mind

So long, this is goodbye
May we meet again in another life
Like strangers passing by
May we see it clearly in a different light

The rivers from your eyes
Can't change my mind

So long, this is goodbye
May we meet again in another life
Like strangers passing by
May we see it clearly in a different light
<E>
<S>
[Verse 1]
In silence is all that helps
Only to feel your existence (stop)
Deny the truth that my life has changed
Hoping that this is all just a dream
Living inside of just what cannot be
No way to read your obituary
In say to in silence
So frequently rain
Bearing the place that reminds me of lain

[Chorus]
This isn't what you really are
Blind folded through the hurt
So sorry
So sorry

[Verse 2]
Memories, my mind still replays
Comforts and thoughts
Still I awake
The presence of you is haunting for chase
Reflecting your image upon my face
Whispers, desires to know your at peace
Blank in the eyes, your vacant to me
Some with the spirit
Entirely thrown
Entirely throng
It's time to move on

[Chorus]

Distant [3x]

Down in still frames
Turning the page
Let go
Let go your hope

[Chorus]
This isn't what you really are
Blind folded through the hurt
So sorry
So sorry (for insult)

Drown in still frame
Turning the page
Let go
Let go your hope

Let go
let go your hope
Let go
Let go your hope
Let go
Let go your hope
Let go
Let go of your hope
<E>

Chasing the rapture

Putrid words
From sharpened tongues
Are spewing them from our mouths
Without a translation
Were just making sounds
The pride of a lion
Is your disguise
But the fear of a cowards
In your eyes

You're chasing the rapture
Praying for a
Perfect disaster
To save us from ourselves
We need more than miracles
We need to answer
For the blood on our hands now
And save us from ourselves

Out sight and Out of mind
Make everything alright
So let the sky and sea collide
Just not in our lifetime
The end is running
Late tonight
The kingdom comes crashing
Down into ashes
Careful what you're asking for

You're chasing the rapture
Praying for a
Perfect disaster
To save us from ourselves
We need more than miracles
We need to answer
For the blood on our hands now
And save us from ourselves

We're comfortable killers
We're comfortable killers
We're comfortable killers
We're comfortable killers
We're comfortable killers
We're comfortable killers
We're comfortable killers

Chasing the rapture
Praying for a
Perfect disaster
To save us from ourselves

You're chasing the rapture
Praying for a
Perfect disaster
To save us from ourselves
We need more than miracles
We need to answer
For the blood on our hands now
And save us from ourselves

We're comfortable killers
We're comfortable killers
We're comfortable killers
We're comfortable killers

Blessed are he who are speaks the word
Pray for the weak and lead the herd
Dollars signs in the faithful eyes
The anti fate on day disguise
You're just a faker
No miracle maker
Holy behavior
Wont make you our savior

If we want a martyr
We'll come and find you
Come and find you
Done before you started
You're dead in the water
Walk on father out to sea
You're done before you started
You're dead in the water

Blessed are he who sees the word
Holiness are well rehearsed
Dollars in the faithful eyes
Anti fates on day disguised
You're just a faker
No miracle maker
Holy behavior
Wont make you our savior

If we want a martyr
We'll come and find you
Come and find you
Done before you started
You're dead in the water
Walk on father out to sea
You're done before you started
You're dead in the water

The water

Money made messiahs
You're televised to tell yours lies
Modern of a martyr
You're dead in the water

If we want a martyr
We'll come and find you
Come and find you
Done before you started
You're dead in the water
Walk on father out to sea
You're done before you started
You're dead in the water
You're dead in the water
You're dead in the water
You're dead in the water

I wanna know
What you really think of me
I wanna feel all the
Pain the sets you free
These waves of doubt
Are drowning me
Gone are the days
When this was easy

Buried in the past
So many moments I want back
Tomorrow doesn't
Hold onto yesterday

If I fall back into you
Don't fight it
Don't fight it
Show me what we've got to lose
Don't hide it
Don't hide it
Memories stuck in my head
All the things I should have said
If I fall back into you
Don't fight it
Don't fight it

I wanna know
After all these lessons learned
If there's a road
From these the bridges the we burned
I need to know
If you still want me
Want to me show how much
I need you

Buried in the past
So many moments I want back
Tomorrow doesn't
Hold onto yesterday

If I fall back into you
Don't fight it
Don't fight it
Show me what we've got to lose
Don't hide it
Don't hide it

Memories stuck in my head
All the things I should have said
If I fall back into you
Don't fight it
Don't fight it

Gone are all of the days this was easy
Tomorrow can't hold onto yesterday

If you come right back to me
I won't fight it
I won't fight it
Show me what you need from me
Don't hide it
Don't hide it

If I fall back into you
Don't fight it
Don't fight it
Show me what we've got to lose
Don't hide it
Don't hide it

Memories stuck in my head
All the things I should have said
If I fall back into you
Don't fight it

Broken shoulders resting on my back
Overloaded with a weighed stack
Higher and higher
Time runs tired

Silence falls
Into the deafening
Sirens of
My own epiphany (x2)

My own mortality

Here I lie with my regrets
Possessions petty meaningless
You are my medicine
Healing me with tenderness

I don't know
Don't go (x4)

I don't know what is happening
What is happening

Broken body crumbles into dust
Weight is lifted sending me with love
Higher and higher
Time expired

The siren calls
Re awakening
Passing on
Into eternity (x2)

Cry no more for me

Crossing through
Fade into (x3)

Crossing through
Fade into the light
Fade into the light

Crossing through [x2]
Fade into the light (x2)

It's taken a lifetime to lose my way
A lifetime of yesterdays
All the wasted time on my hands
Turns to sand
And fades in the wind
Crossing lines
Small crimes
Taking back what is mine

I'm fine in the fire
I feed on the friction
I'm right where I should be
Don't try and fix me
I'm fine in the fire
I feed on the friction
I'm right where I should be
Don't try and fix me

So lost for so long
To find to my way
I failed to follow
I'm out of place
Crossing lines
Small crimes
Taking back what is mine

I'm fine in the fire
I feed on the friction
I'm right where I should be
Don't try and fix me

I'm fine in the fire
I feed on the friction
I'm right where I should be
Don't try and fix me

I'm fine in the fire
I feed on the friction
I'm right where I should be
Don't try and fix me

I'm fine in the fire
I feed on the friction
I'm right where I should be
Don't try and fix me

I'm fine in the fire
I feed on the friction
I'm right where I should be
Don't try and fix me

I'm fine in the fire
I feed on the friction
I'm right where I should be
Don't try and fix me

Appetites reach all time highs
No ones seems to care who dies
Prey on every little thing in sight
To kill or be killed state of mind
Anything to stay alive
Never ever show your terrified

It's a common casualty
To trust in what you see
Saints and scholars
Don't even bother
The bullet in the blood
Came from those you love
Friendly fires
Death by a liar

Dumb, deaf and blind
(Dumb, deaf and blind)
Fall back in line
(Fall back in line)

Now is the time
To open your eyes
You need it, you want it,
You did it, you got it
So act like you own it this time
The coma of lies
Comfort your mind
Your feeding the fire
And bleeding desire
It's down to the wire this time

Focus now on how to gain
Loyalty from enemies
Waiting patiently for when to strike

The bullet in the blood
Came from those you trust
Friendly fires
Death by a liar

Dumb, deaf and blind
(Dumb, deaf and blind)
Fall back in line
(Fall back in line)

Now is the time
To open your eyes
You need it, you want it,
You did it, you got it
So act like you own it this time

Comfort your mind

And bleeding desire
It's down to the wire this time

These ravenous bastards always get what they're after
These ravenous bastards always get what they're after
These ravenous bastards always get what they're after
These ravenous bastards

Them vultures swarm in circles like a storm
The carnivores rip into the core
For more and more and more
They rip into the core

Now is the time
To open your eyes
You need it, you want it,
You did it, you got it
So act like you own it this time
The coma of lies
Comfort your mind

The walls are closing in around us
We hold our silence like a gun
Your stare is empty and a scene that keeps repeating
And I just bite my tongue

They can't take this away
Its far from over
We can't take stay in a place
We don't belong
For one more day
I'm not afraid to fall
For one more day
We try to save it all

Footsteps will fade away the memories
Unload the words and breath again
Our eyes are focused on an unexplored horizon
On what has always been

They can't take this away
It's far from over
We can't stay in a place
We don't belong
For one more day
I'm not afraid to fall
For one more day
We try to save it all

I wont let you look back
If you will help me see
Clearly

They can't take this away
It's far from over
We can't stay in a place
We don't belong
For one more day
I'm not afraid to fall
For one more day
Far from over
We try to save it all

The sounds bounce around
The noise just drowns me out
To fast to focus
Nothing is showing any sign of slowing down
Dreams feed to me
In the form of a magazine
I can't control it
Channels have chosen what I'm supposed to be

It's hopeless
As far as I can see
There's no rest
Because we're stuck on repeat

Stand here and wait
For the to finally stop running in place
Chasing after what we don't need
Keep running
I'll stand here and wait for the world

Bright flashing lights
The ads just fill me eyes
Colors colliding
Voices inviting me to buy a better life
She speaks to me
He knows just what I mean
I can't control it
I have to own it
Everything is made of green

It's hopeless
As far as I can see
There's no rest
Because we're stuck on repeat

Stand here and wait
For the to finally stop running in place
Chasing after what we don't need
Keep running
I'll stand here and wait for the world

For the world to finally stop
Chasing after what we want
Take it all away
Flush it all away
We won't change

I'll stand here and wait
For the to finally stop running in place
Chasing after what we don't need
Keep running
I'll stand here and wait for the world

For the world to stop
For the world to stop
For the world to stop
For the world to finally stop

Shoot it, shoot it out cuz they want it, want it now, now.

Shoot it, shoot it out cuz they want it, want it now, now.
Shoot it, shoot it out cuz they want it, want it now.
Shoot it, shoot it out cuz they want a little more, you can be rest assured.
You give them all you got and you give them a little more and
you never even know what for.
They feed and they suck until you're unconscious.
It's never enough, they kill your subconscious.

I'm ready to die.

Will you kill what's left of me to stop the bleeding?
(Shoot it, shoot it out cuz they want it, want it now, now)

Suffocate integrity till I'm not breathing.

Feed them, fucking starve them, keep begging a little more.
Feed them, fucking starve them, keep begging a little more.
Feed them, fucking starve them, keep begging a little more.
I'm not gonna be your whore.
Load it, cock it, pull it, refuse to be ignored.
I'm not gonna fight your war.
All the distractions kill the compassion.
Suddenly fame has lost its attraction.

I'm ready to die.

Will you kill what's left of me to stop the bleeding?
(Shoot it, shoot it out cuz they want it, want it now, now)
(Shoot it, shoot it out cuz they want it, want is now, now)
Suffocate integrity till I'm not breathing.

Forced myself to sleep last night
Woke up to all white
Saw all the tears and cries
Screamed out with no reply
Nirvana dreams were never right
When crossing to the other side
It's too late to take this back
This accidental exit

Now what's in store for a
Soul with premature
Wings that will never soar
For what they're made for

Why we wingless angels fall
We'll die if our wings don't grow at all
So tell me why we wingless angels fall
We'll die if our wings don't grow at all

Life is always strange
Signs lie wondering
Mental sodomy
This can't be happening
<E>
<S>
She, She is the love that you make and break
And He, He is the drug that you hate to crave
And I, I am the liar you made to praise
And You, You are the one that we want and need

Who will convince us?
The Wickeds Will
Who will condemn us?
The Wickeds will
Who will defend us?
Always
We are the Wicked ones who adore you
The Wicked ones will destroy you
We are the lost of your innocence
The Wicked ones coming for you

We, We are the scar on the skin again
Massive lines of wondering eyes
Waiting, waiting to be bastard eyes
Monopolized selling clones of every kind

Who will convince us?
The Wickeds Will
Who will condemn us?
The Wickeds will
Who will defend us?
Always
We are the Wicked ones who adore you
The Wicked ones will destroy you
We are the lost of your innocence
The Wicked ones coming for you

Kill yourself to save yourself from yourself [x3]

Before you become one of us [x2]

We are the Wicked ones who adore you
The Wicked ones will destroy you
We are the lost of your innocence
The Wicked ones (The wicked ones)

You will become one of us

No one knows
The secrets that I keep
No one knows
What's in my head
I can't control
The other side of me
I have lost my breath

Breaking
The pulse of a steady beat
Pleading for sanity
The voices calling out my name

Now I'm afraid
That I am waking up the ghost
I'm digging up the memories
That were dead to me
Now, now I'm getting close
Closer to the enemy
That's inside of me

Under the skin
The soul of the guilty
Under the surface
Lonely lies
Under the weight
The sin is
Eating me alive

No mercy
No forgiveness
Condemn to my own hell
The voices calling out my name

Now I'm afraid
That I am waking up the ghost
Not taking out the memories
That were dead to me
Now, now I'm getting close
Closer to the enemy that's inside of me

I am waking up the ghost
I'm digging up the memories
That were dead to me, dead to me
I am waking up the ghost
I'm digging up the memories (dead to me)
That were dead to me
Now, now I'm getting close
Closer to the enemy
That's inside of me (inside of me)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Here we in are red
Suffocating in this tie
Down with you with me
Unable to breathe force fed
Blind to this so long
Thread in mouth all senses gone
Leaves my back my chest
Six feet down it's buried dead

Turn to your back and walk away

(cut out the face, do as I say)
Twisting and turning why isn't this working
(cut out the face) For what cause
(do as I say) At what cost
Twisting and turning why isn't this working

Beg plead and scream
Show me what you will
Ill watch straight faced
Not another cheek
Eyes swollen
A shape I'd like to kill
Here you are in red
Stunned as you may feel

Turn to your back and walk away

(cut out the face, do as I say)
Twisting and turning why isn't this working
(cut out the face) For what cause
(do as I say) At what cost
Twisting and turning why isn't this working

I'm lifting a burden
Pointless diversion

Just try
<E>
<S>
Crouched low his decision is made
Even though he feels his courage fading
He knows in his heart that they are here
He draws his sword and sheathes his fear

So please just let me out
So please just let me out
So please just let me out
Then I could focus

Burning one more
Baptized in fire
Burning one more

She cries and she screams but her best never clears
She drops and kneels and her lips are bare
So please just let me out 'cuz there's nothing left to say
And as she stands she knows I'm right there
She tucks her face, her tears are gone
Strength in their place

So please just let me out
So please just let me out
And if you let me out
Then I could focus

Burning one more
Baptized in fire
Burning one more
Baptized in fire
Broken, this stage
Found their strength through rage
So much more that

Fallaway
Fallaway

Looking into dark skies makes you
Feel this lonelyness that breaks you.

But you made it through this (x2)

The stars shine,
To tell you it's okay now.
Your fighting,
But you still cannot breathe now.

But you made it through this (x2)

I know you hate this.
The tears roll down your face.
To pale complections,
Are stone and won't erase.

Your eyes closed,
Every night waiting to be there.
The morning fucks your plan.
When will you breathe?

But you made it through this (x2)

I know you hate this.
The tears roll down your face,
To pale complections,
Are stone and won't erase. (x2)

And then it's not down to wiles
Hours erode the days away
These years of infinity
Recycle and repeat this
Rebirth

Dont shoot the messenger
You're the killer at your door

Magnify
The moment's we have lived
Pacify
The past lives we've laid to rest

And all the other colors
Are leaving this body and mind
Behind
Become another level
Leading into the divine
Divine

This crippled reality of tangible fantasies
Can't be, can't be, can't be
Our walls breathe, to a heartbeat
Are you a messenger, or the killer at my door?

And all the other colors
Are leaving this body and mind
Behind
Become another level
Leading into the divine
Divine

It's no good, no good, no
It's no good, no good, no good, no

Are you looking?
Yes, what should I see?
I've never seen such infinite beauty in my life
I wish I could talk in Technicolor
I feel sorry for you, if you can't see it than you'll
just never know.

And all the other colors
Are leaving this body and mind
Behind
Become another level
Leading into the divine

Become one with the energy

And all the other colors
Are leaving this body and mind

Counting sheep's never reach
Sound asleep fantasies
Suck me dry
Insomnia
Settle in sedatives
Silence these sirens
I am uncomfortably numb
Requiems serenade
Chariots carrying
All who fall from grace
Hang hallowed halos
Where shallow graves grow
Too old to die young
So dammed hard to find serenity
Never fret why the dead dont fly
Now mature into obscurity
Severing sanity
Pay the price
With the souls of the innocent
With the blood of another limb
Paralyzed
By the sins of a guilty man
Dirty hands playing God again
Bible bruised black and blue
Karma comes over due
Conscience now constantly runs
Counting sheep's never reach
Sound asleep fantasies
Suck me dry
Insomnia
Settle in sedatives
Silence these sirens
I am uncomfortably numb
So dammed hard to find serenity
Never fret why the dead dont fly
Now mature into obscurity
Severing sanity
Pay the price
With the souls of the innocent
With the blood of another lamb
Paralyzed
By the sins of a guilty man
Dirty hands playing God again
Come why keep killing time?
Cutting like knives, you're cutting like knives
Wake up, wake up, wake up dead fly
Wake up, wake up, wake up dead fly
Wake up, wake up, wake up dead fly
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up dead fly
Wake up, wake up, wake up dead fly
Dead fly
Pay the price
With the souls of the innocent
With the blood of another lamb
Paralyzed
By the sins of a guilty man
Dirty hands playing God again
Come why keep killing time?
Cutting like knives, you're cutting like knives

So is your life with worth saving?
Or is your picture fading?

Over exposure of repetition blinds ambition slowly
Frozen in motion the time is ticking by with every moment
No one takes notice of their incandescent adolescents glowing
Sweet songs won't last too long

So is your life worth saving?
Or is your picture fading?
Bound to these broken memories
This story has no ending

Older, and older, these wandering eyes never close up
A funeral for failure now your final hour as a coward's over
Sad songs won't last too long

So is your life worth saving?
Or is your picture fading?
Bound to these broken memories
This story has no ending

Baptized in fire
Baptized in fire before you expire

So is your life worth savin' now?
Bound to these broken memories

So is your life worth saving?
Or is your picture fading?
Bound to these broken memories
This story has no ending

Baptized in fire
Baptized in fire before you expire

The fact that your opinion's wrong
You never listen at all
With our backs against the wall
We become what we are told
Apologize, sympathize
Will it ever end?
I promise I see your side
But I'll never bend
Lovers, (lovers), liars, (liars),
Colder than death, you're colder than death
Spotlight, (spotlight), cancer, (cancer),
Filling your head, killing regret
Dare me to cross the line
I'll see you on the other side
Heavy hands, fragile hearts, are tearing us apart
Lovers, (lovers), liars, (liars),
Colder than death, you're colder than death
Spotlight, (spotlight), cancer, (cancer),
Filling your head, killing regret
Bound in the battle lust
Everything turns to dust
Lovers, (lovers), liars, (liars),
Colder than death, you're colder than death
Spotlight, (spotlight), cancer, (cancer),
Filling your head, killing regret

Blaze rage red is the color of youth
Be careful what you do
Another dead, color bled, blue is new
Be careful what you choose

Little white lies, trouble hides the truth
Bury your excuse
Every bird sings when they're envy green
It's time to come clean

Fallin' like a stone again
Dive in, deeper down you go
Take me all the way to the end
Show me how you want it to end

Keep dancing with the dead
Go ahead
Keep dancing with the dead

Eyes pitch black with the heart attacks
You can barely move
The other weak ones were the first to run
Your loyalty is through

Every word's gold when the story's told
It's time for you to fold

Fallin' like a stone again
Dive in, deeper down you go
Take me all the way to the end
Show me how you want it to end

Keep dancing with the dead
Go ahead
Keep dancing with the dead

The devil's in your head
Filling in the stance
God is playing dead
So save your breath

Take me all the way to the end
Show me how you want it to end

Keep dancing with the dead
Go ahead
Keep dancing with the dead

You're not alone
They're closer than you know
And now there's ghosts
In the machines we host
The reasons we find
Over and over we replay the ride
Deep into you
They spread their roots
Satellites
Send us a savior
Satisfy these sinful behaviors
Ooooh
We want the world in the palm of our hands
So incomplete, minus machine
Dying to know and control on command
So incomplete, minus machine
Kill the lights forever
Locked in place, pupils dilate
And stimulates, increasing our heart rate
Entranced by the light, higher and higher we try to fly
Burn in the flames, deep in the strain
Satellites
Send us a savior
Satisfy these sinful behaviors
Ooooh

Please, for me, don't you cave in
Or lose sight, otherwise they win
Please, believe your creation
Will breathe life in due time
Otherwise they win

Confusing a ghost (ghost)
For a brand new cure
You're losing control (control)
End a martyr's 'cause

You're wondering, once before
So clean and pure
But clarity's hard to keep
Within reach
Your celebration
Left a snake in
And woke the dead
Demons come back for more
To open up the sore

Confusing a ghost (ghost)
For a brand new cure
You're losing control (control)
End a martyr's 'cause

From victim to villain we came throwing stones
Using, abusing your own
From victim to villain we came throwing stones
Using, abusing the throne

Using, abusing your own
Using, abusing the throne

Confusing a ghost (ghost)

The smok and haze of yesterdays
Setting dates with early graves
These spinning plates will one day break
Warning signs tomorrows
Running on time borrowed
Mother's not married, so father be wary
Of what you preach
Stay asleep at the wheel and never
Care to know
The crash is coming
Will we end the line with Myan signs
Or millions led to no surprise
Tidal wave of smoke and haze
Quick to have the trigger pulled
Who will be accountable
Brother wears able, 'cause father won't pay for
What you've done
Stay asleep at the wheel and never
Care to know
The crash is coming
Are we destined to see a tragedy?
Look away, the crash is coming
Mother, daughter, son and father
Lead to the slaughter
We drink from the water
And bleed at the altar
You preach with a loaded gun
Stay asleep at the wheel and never
Care to know
The crash is coming
Are we destined to see a tragedy?
Look away, the crash is coming

Over exposure of repetition blinds ambition slowly
Frozen in motion, time is ticking by with every moment
No one takes notice of their incandescent adolescences glowing
Sweet songs won't last too long
Breathe in, deep

Closure and rest
Older and older
These wandering eyes never close up
A funeral for failure, now
Your final hour as a coward's over
Sad songs won't last too long
Breathe in, deep
Stop holding your breath
We need peace
Closure and rest
Tightrope stop walking on wire
And let go, euphoria
Tightrope stop walking on wire and fly
Breathe in, deep
Stop holding your breath
We need peace
Closure and rest
Breathe in, deep
Stop holding your breath
We need peace
Closure and rest
Tightrope stop walking on wire

The scenery decays
Through vacant eyes
Fading all I see
To black and white
No colors to describe
No voice to reply
My emotions slowly die
No lows or highs, I'm flatlined
The writing on the walls
May be foreign to us all
'Cause the casualties of war
Haven't changed us much at all
Reality replays through strain and strife
Causing crashing waves to change the tides
Wash away the lines
Erase the space in time
New emotions, show a sign
Hold to life down a flatline
The writing on the walls
May be foreign to us all
'Cause the casualties of war
Haven't changed us much at all
I won't let you bury me
You're not ready to bear the weight
I won't let you bury me
You're not ready to bear the weight
I won't let you bury me
You're not ready to bear the weight
I won't let you bury me
You're not ready to bear the weight
I won't let you bury me

Are we predisposed as embryos
To find a soul somewhere
Down this rabbit hole
Rapidly adapting
We struggle with this gravity
Trying to stay on our feet

Ashes to ashes
Dust into dust
Lay your memories
Out to rust

Complicate, confuse, and change
Every conscious move we make
Constantly consuming days
Without a clue of what to do
Stumbling on this reckless youth
Trying to find some truth

Ashes to ashes
Dust into dust
Lay your memories
Out to rust

Ashes to ashes
Dust into dust
Lay your memories
Out to rust
Bittersweet melodies
Amazing grace haunting me

Memories fade to gray
Ashes to ashes

Excite and more less or more between the lines
Die, adore, bride and whore ignore, remind

Ashes to ashes
Dust into dust
Lay your memories
Out to rust
Bittersweet melodies
Amazing grace haunting me

Memories fade to gray
Ashes to ashes

Tonight our separating sides
Unite as we try
To tame our tongues
Don't beg the question or
Kill with confession this time
Let's black out the sun and the sky
And paint the town red tonight
To feel alive
We will be kings and queens

Killer creator? Blow me away
I am your loaded gun
Killer creator? Blow me away
You are my chosen one

Out of our minds
Naive and younger
Inspiring this hunger inside
Invincible as a lie,
Chasing horizon lines to feel alive
Your disease cures me

Killer creator? Blow me away
I am your loaded gun
Killer creator? Blow me away
You are my chosen one

Our separating sides unite

Killer creator? Blow me away
I am your loaded gun
Killer creator? Blow me away
You are my chosen one

You're next in line to love me for the night
So say goodbye and leave me on high
Don't darken my door with your light.
Your long winded lies of a short mended life
I die by design on a dime.
Drag me along singing this song.
Bury my bones when the glory is gone
The infection has led to the heart and the head
The infection has led to the heart and the head

All my monuments of accomplishments
Are lost and left behind
How do I find an end,
I can't remember how this began
There's no loyalty in shooting stars
Just lawyer fees and failure scars
For every birth there is a death,
For every sunrise there is a set
Half past my prime that spark in my eye
Is discolored and oxidized
And all that resides is how to survive
And provide when this dream as died

Farewell welfare, farewell welfare

Don't darken my door with your light,
Long winded lies of a short mended life
I die by design on a dime.
Bury my bones when the glory is gone

Farewell welfare, farewell welfare
We're dying in stereo from birth to burial
We're dying in stereo from birth to burial

So say goodbye, you loved me for the night

Farewell welfare, farewell welfare
We're dying in stereo from birth to burial
We're dying in stereo from birth to burial

I spoke too soon, but you hung the moon
And don't even have a clue
Bright eyes stay tucked away
Deep inside your golden age safety suit
Your golden age safety suit of youth

A little rule, a little sway
To navigate though your maze
Of love and pain
We bond and break
Though love and pain,
We bond and break

So rain down on my head (My head, my head)
When the sky cracks open (Sky cracks open)
And your pain comes
Let the flood run though my lungs
When the rain comes
I'll bleed the sun, (The sun)
When the rain comes

So now I see you're free from me
I wait patiently for you to breathe
<E>
<S>
I set the mood that tingles in you
You've got the womb I love to intrude
Well disguise the blushing bride
Apple of my eye
Inviting virus you amuse, so make your move

Running faster
You're on your own

Clue by clue, odds are aiming at you
Can you take the tune when your fate is in bloom?
Sleight of hand has made a mess
Letters laid to rest
Screaming sirens sing the blues
We play to lose

Running faster
You're on your own
Chasing the dragon

We made our saving grace Christ to sell
When there's hell to pay, who gets the bell?
Now you're in limbo, searching for a loophole
But you gave up the ghost long ago
You gave up the ghost long ago

Running faster
You're on your own
Chasing the dragon

Shadows in sheep's clothes
Lead us to the gallows
But you gave up the ghost long ago
(I'd rather sink than swim)
You gave up the ghost long ago
(I'd rather sink than swim)
Gave up the ghost long ago
<E>
<S>
I'd rather sink then swim
Give up, give in, and let my demons win again.
My whole life I've tried to keep my head above water
And out of the clouds I'm face down on middle ground

So I release this breathe
From my chest
As I lay to rest
Deeper and deeper
With a fish
I pray peace may find me

Moisture residue
Slowly killing you
Moisture residue
Slowly killing you
Moisture residue
Slowly killing you
Moisture residue
Slowly killing you
Moisture residue

Aim high as you look to the sky
And shoot for the stars
Playing darts in the dark
Lose control as you go for broke
Giving one for the money
And two for the show

Chasing your tail
Till the brain swells
And your heart turns pale
Enter the void
As you search and destroy.
But can you avoid
Getting lost in the noise

You're desperately selling skeletons
Until there's nothing left

Everything falls apart,
Keep relying on dead stars

With everyone's eye on the prize
We kiss our loyalty goodbye
And it should come as no surprise
When we live and die
By rolling the dice

Cut me to the core
For more and more and more
Cut me to the core
For more and more and more

Desperately selling skeletons
Until there's nothing left of me

Everything falls apart,
Keep relying on dead stars
<E>

Sail away in sore eyes
Searching for your soul
Further from my shoreline
I pray that your sore eyes float

And are there any survivors, survivors?
And are there any survivors, survivors here?

Lost in the moonlight
You crash into my coast
I'm waiting for your high tide
To wash away my sore eyed soul

And are there any survivors, survivors?
And are there any survivors, survivors here?

Wide awake in the bed you've made
Wide awake in the bed you've made

And are there any survivors, survivors?
And are there any survivors, survivors here?

And are there any survivors, survivors? (Survivors here?)
And are there any survivors, survivors here?

Just keep digging, digging, digging
down that hole
clawing, scraping, tearing to the bone
never wait or hesitate to feed the hollow
biting off more than we could ever swallow
here we go around that halo of hope
keeping close the miracles we chose
we keep tilling, churning, turning over every stone
running, chasing to and from the hollow

the river wont tell us which way to go
chaos of the lost
filling that hole with our weight in gold
careless of the cost

voices clashing causing a prophecy of noise
crosses cracking, crumbling, fall in to the void
dare we know the halo's hanging low
waiting to choke every opposing throat

the river wont tell us which way to go
chaos of the lost
filling that hole with our weight in gold
careless of the cost

confusion of the lost
in the land of scatterbrains who will lead the way
chaos comes from the cross
monetary masquerade
religious rat race
do or die and down the drain, fight or flight parade

the river wont tell us which way to go
chaos of the lost
filling that hole with our weight in gold
careless of the cost

confusion of the cross

Where's your verse, your verb, proverb, lesson learned
Are you our of words, out of time, out of mind. (No, I'm doin' fine)
What's the worst that could happen if the nurse
Ain't back when your birth turns blue (It's a matter of time)
With a doubting will to live keep downing
Little pills down a little bit more in you

No feelings, smooth sailing, in this sinking ship

Taking the devil in the details again and again
Wasting every bit of free will from your skin

Oh, there's no way to save a shred of the day
When it's weathered and worn away nightly
We keep killing time in the blink of an eye
Trying to walk a straight line with a kaleidoscope eyes
As we're flooding the brain till the levees break
With no memory we're destined to repeat this injury

No feelings, smooth sailing, in this sinking ship

Taking the devil in the details again and again
Wasting every bit of free will from your skin
Was it what you wanted (taken)
Forbidden from the garden (wasted)
Was it what you wanted.
The devil in the details again and again

I've used up all the time I've borrowed
Who will reunite when the tomb is hollow

Taking the devil in the details again and again
Wasting every bit of free will from your skin
Was it what you wanted (taken)
Forbidden from the garden (wasted)
Was it what you wanted.
The devil in the details again and again
<E>
<S>
Bruises keep me moving,
Abused by your precious pressures
Hopelessly hopeful, romantically numb
Way too close for closure to come

Around and round we go
With the rise and fall of your vertigo
Spinning out of control,
Forever maybe only made in our dreams

Minimize my movements,
Amused by your grand illusions
No love and no hate
Just phantom pains,
Too soon, too late to amputate

Around and round we go
With the rise and fall of your vertigo
Spinning out of control,
Forever maybe only made in our dreams

Hesitating hearts starving to start falling apart

Around and round we go
With the rise and fall of your vertigo
Around and round we go
With the rise and fall of your vertigo
Spinning out of control,
Forever maybe only made in our dreams
(Only made in our dreams)
(Only made in our dreams)
(Only made in our dreams)

And hit him whip out 10 stacks to keep it open longer

Chipping on the eree-herb till it's right down to the nub

The beat got her tripping, and the heat got her pumping
And she screaming at the DJ don't stop playing that

at a time when my girl was tryin to crowd me
ohh damn

Baby tell me why, why do you question
All this love that I have for you
If you look into my eyes you'll make an exception
I will show you love like no one before
Put your trust in me, allow me to be there
Baby give me your hand to hold
Cause the feelings that I have are so complicated
That words cannot explain there is only one who knows

[Chorus]
Only God knows how much I love you
God sees my heart and that it cares about you
God knows that I'm thinking of you
And I'm longing for you, how I wish that you knew what God Knows

Baby tell me what, what is the reason
One good reason you're so insecure
Cause after all that I have done
I think you should know by now
Girl I'm down for you and the love I have is pure
I want to help you understand just how I feel for you
You're the one that I can't let go
Because the feeling that I have is so complicated
That words cannot explain there is only one who knows

[Chorus: x2]

And all of my lonely days, only God knows how lonely
And oh the sleepless nights baby, only God sees me cry
And every time I think of you, only God can read my mind
God knows I tried to help you understand
And Heaven knows I miss you
Only God can see how much
Cause every time you go away, I long for your touch
And when I say I love you girl, only God sees my heart
He sees my heart, only God knows

[Chorus]

Yo, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay its T.I.P man, king of the south
Rubber band man, boing

Letting all those suckers for lord know man
Keep you girl out the club if you want em
Make no mistake we will take your broads

We be rolling with T.I.
See you come through
Baby quit your man he be cuffing you
And we like wow, jeans on you
Chick got a fat ass what she needs too
Baby don't care in them streets
Seeing how bad you want to give it to me
I was saying no
To get in there sweet
She better know what the rules gon' be

When you stick, when we split ain't no hits
Won't you come here with me
I'm a chill, how cite you are
What you don't know how to let it go
You're thick, body sick, got that trip
Keep this between you and me
You can get it any time you want
That's one thing you gotta know

If I Hit
Promise
I ain't gotta hear nothing from ya
Yo nigga riding up with that drama
Saying I done cut this woman
If I Hit
Promise
There ain't gonna be no drama
Tell you yet, cause I think I love em
'Cause you let me bend that over
If I Hit

Say it, don't flinch, let me shirt this flick
Wasn't you the one who said you love to drive stick
Now you want to front like you're scared of it
When at the bar you started grabbing it
I already know how to handle you
Can do you
Before I put the hands on you
I'm a beat that thing
Like your man should do
But I don't want a repercussion when we do

When you stick, when we split ain't no hits
Won't you come here with me
I'm a chill, how cite you are
What you don't know how to let it go
You're thick, body sick, got that trip
Keep this between you and me
You can get it any time you want
That's one thing you gotta know

[Repeat: x2]
If I Hit

Yo nigga riding up with that drama
Saying I done cut this woman
If I Hit

There ain't gonna be no drama
Tell you yet, cause I think I love em
'Cause you let me bend that over
If I Hit

The grey goose make you want to get loose
Got your ass bent over in the new Benz coupe
'Cause the rims same color as the ride and the roof
Or maybe cause your friend want to ride with me too
Maybe it's the way a nigga shine in the suit
Or a fresh white tee whatever it might be
A neck like ro or a wrist like freeze
Rings like those, cuff links like these
Baby you ain't never met a man like me
Turn a 9 to a 10 if you can excite me
Before I get one, but you get like 3
Gotta man well you know there's a chance you might cheat
Brothers gonna come up with plans to fight me
I'm only gonna tell em once, have em finished like a G
You're running with the baldest cannon, I'm gonna pull
So before you take off you're panties
What you have to understand

If I Hit
Promise
I ain't gotta hear nothing from ya
Yo nigga riding up with that drama
Saying I done cut this woman
If I Hit
Promise
There ain't gonna be no drama
Tell you yet, cause I think I love em
'Cause you let me bend that over
If I Hit

Body sick
Gotta come here with me

Sorry is not enough
After all the things I've done to you
So I just want to let you know that I am more than sorry
Sorry is not enough to take away the ?
So I just want to let you know that I am more than sorry
I'm more than sorry, girl I'm more than sorry ([echo:] sorry)
<E>
<S>
Why do you make me feel this way?
I'm feeling betrayed feeling pushed away
Why do you make me feel so mad?
I'm feeling so hurt, I'm feeling so sad
What have I done to make you turn?
I'm feeling so lost, I'm feeling so burned
If you really, can you make a change
So I can feel pleasure's and not the pain
<E>
<S>
Lately I have been questioning if what we have is lost
I heard it in your voice when we were fighting
Tell me where it's gone?

Girl I thought that we could talk about whatever
Any problem that we had we'd always work it together
Did I say or is there something I've done wrong
Baby I should know, but I don't, still I want to make it better

[Chorus]
If something's hurting you then girl let me know
If it's me then baby tell me
You don't have to ignore, you don't want this anymore
Just don't let me be the last to know

Honestly you got me torn and I'm so confused
Cause nowadays you got a new attitude
And you barely answer my calls and when I finally get through
You rush of the line like I don't matter to you

Was it something I said, girl what did I do
If there's a problem it ain't hard for us to work it out
There's no difference from what we've been through before
I can't move on and I won't until we make it better

[Chorus]
If something's hurting you then girl let me know
If it's me then baby tell me
You don't have to ignore, you don't want this anymore
Just don't let me be the last to know

I never believed we go this far
Don't you let people tell what we have past

[Chorus]
If something's hurting you then girl let me know
If it's me then baby tell me
You don't have to ignore, you don't want this anymore
Just don't let me be the last to know [3x till fade]
<E>
<S>
Girl I don't understand, stand the reason why, why you act this way
What did I do, tell me what the problem is
I don't want to see, want to see you leave
Want to let you go, I just want to find a way to work it out

We've been through so much, good and bad times
Girl I did you wrong, you forgave me then we tried to start over
I apologized tried to make it right, so many times
Now I think its time to let this go

[Chorus: x2]
And even though I love you and you've been with me for so long
And we thought that we could make it work but we were wrong
But neither one of us want to be the first to say goodbye
Baby I think its time to let this go

Girl it's hard for me to tell you that it's over
I hate feeling this way
But I know you know things just haven't been the same
We always said that we, we would tell the truth
No matter what it is, can't continue to pretend our heart is in it

I'm waiting for you to see, the reality
We at dead end, there no way to go unless we gonna to be just friends
I love you so much, never thought that I would ever have to say
That I think its time to let this go

[Chorus: x2]

[Bridge]
Oh girl
What happened to the love
What happen to the girl
The girl I fell in love with
I never thought I'd been the one to say goodbye
I'm sick and tried of the arguing and I don't want to do it again
Again, woo

[Chorus: x2]
<E>
<S>
[Chorus]
If I could erase, everyone of my mistakes
Tell me would it make you want to come over
And work this out with me
And I'd do whatever it takes just meet me half way
All I want is for you to come over and work this out(work this out)with me.

What's wrong with me, why can't I do right
You promised me you'd give me your life
If I could be more then just a typical
Guy to lie to your face
How could I do, the things that I said I wouldn't do
Give them the same, I give to you
Am I just a pitiful franken as your worth-(Not sure what it says there lol.)

You told me that before
Promised that I wouldn't go there no more
You gave me all of you, but what did I go do
And every time I had a chance to get into another niggas woman's pants
I would follow through, not thinking of me and you

[Chorus]

If I could erase, everyone of my mistakes
Tell me would it make you want to come over
And work this out with me
And I'd do whatever it takes just meet me half way
All I want is for you to come over and work this out(work this out)with me.

As bad as I want you right here,
Empathize with the way that you feel,
Took away the things, that you called your kids(I'm so sorry baby I'm needing you)
If you can find the feeling you had from the start you know we should never be apart
I'm asking can you to please listen to me

Well you told me that before
Promised that I wouldn't go there no more
You gave me all of you, but what did I go do
And every time I had a chance to get into another niggas woman's pants
I would follow through, not thinking of me and you

[Chorus: x2]

If I could erase, everyone of my mistakes
Tell me would it make you want to come over
And work this out with me
And I'd do whatever it takes just meet me half way
All I want is for you to come over and work this out(work this out)with me.

Well I want you to come over and talk to me
I know I don't deserve to be apart of anyone tryin' to give me their heart (but I'm in need)
Baby please, come on over and talk to me
I see you lookin' like I've seen you look before
'Cause your the only one to show me real love(I'm in need)

[Chorus: x3]

If I could erase, everyone of my mistakes
Tell me would it make you want to come over
And work this out with me
And I'd do whatever it takes just meet me half way
All I want is for you to come over and work this out (work this out) with me.

If ever you wondered
If ever you were nervous about it
You gotta know,
I ain't never,
Lemme say that again,
I ain't never, goin' nowhere
Listen to me

Last night I almost cried when you told me
That you think you love me more than I love you
Sometimes it hurts to carry that burden alone
Lets be clear and get a few things straight
No ones ever gonna take your place in my heart
Nothing can measure the love that I've got for you
I'm telling you

When I'm out in the club at night
You don't have to worry about a thing
'cause I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't goin' nowhere,
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
that I'm gon be with for the rest of my life
And I ain't goin' nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You don't have to worry no more
'cause I ain't goin' nowhere
Baby just trust me
As long as you love me
I ain't never goin' nowhere

I was lost and abandoned
Searching for the truth
Looking for that missing one
That missing one was you
The road was so tough
But you gave it up
until I found you and you made it
Worth the wait and worth the years
Worth the strength and worth the tears
And you don't know the half of it
But baby here's the rest of it

Did you know that your a gift far brighter than the sun?
Did you know that your a blessing, and I'm the lucky one
Did you know that I could never ask for a better love
Did you know that I would die, before I broke your heart
Did you know that if you left me, my world would fall apart
And never come back together, baby that's for real
So the next time that you tell me, you'll remember this

When I'm out in the club at night
You don't have to worry about a thing
'cause I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't goin' nowhere,
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
that I'm gon be 'with for the rest of my life
And I ain't goin nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You don't have to worry no more
'cause I ain't goin' nowhere
Baby just trust me
As long as you love me
I ain't never goin' nowhere

When I'm out in the club at night
You don't have to worry about a thing
'cause I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't goin' nowhere,
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
that I'm gon be with for the rest of my life
And I ain't goin' nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You don't have to worry no more
'cause I ain't goin' nowhere
Baby just trust me
As long as you love me
I ain't never goin' nowhere

112  That's How Close We Are

Without the root, you ain't got no tree
And without the branches, you ain't got no leaves
To understand her is to understand me
Cause that's how close we are
Without a sea, you ain't got no air
And it ain't no walking if you ain't got the legs
Understand I use them eyes to see
That's how close we are

Heart to heart
Breath to Breath
She fills me up till there ain't none left
No space, no time
Her sprits my mind
You see that's how close we are
That's how close we are (X2)

Without the stars, there's no galaxy
And without the river, you don't have no sea
Just look at my life, and it's her you'll see
Cause that's how close we are
And without a voice no one could hear you sing
And it ain't flying without the wings
So when you see me flying
It's her carrying me
That's how close we are

Chorus

She talks with me
She walks with me
She's holding me
And yes, She's teaching me
Everything I can't do
Everything I can't say
She does for m
She prays with me
She cries with me
She's loving me
Nothing could compare to the love we share
So that woman and man
Who understands you can say:

Chorus

That's how close we are (x10)

Lately we been talkin' on the two way
About what you like about what I like
And I think it's about time we do somethin' about it at home

It's been so long, since
You had a man in your life
And weather you know it or not
You need someone to touch that spot that you love
And baby I'm willin' to give you what you've been missin'
Don't tell my girl

What I need to know is

Baby I want you
Would you freak me
Would you freak me in the way
The way that I freak you
The way that I freak you

Where your man didn't touch ya
Cause he had ya baby
Don't say no baby
Just let me have my way with you

Been so long since you
Had a man in you life
Weather you know it or not
You need someone to touch that spot

I would walk, I would walk, I would walk
A thousand miles, if I knew that you
Would be waiting on the other side
I would climb, I would climb, I would climb
The highest mountain,
If you would fulfill the promise to be mine oh mine
I would swim, the seven seas
If we could sit down and talk about us
And agree to agree
I would walk without water
Across the death of sand
To here you say you're ready to be in love again
People are talking, trying to build us apart
They can't see the love in our hearts
Girl I care about you and you care about me
And if we believe in each other
We goin' be alright, yes we will
We goin' be alright, alright
We goin' be alright, yes we will
If we believe in each other
We goin' be alright, alright!

(What if) what if I never slept around, never cheated on you girl
(What if) what if didn't break your heart and never ever ruined you world
(What if) what if I always was a real man, face to face to face told you the truth?
(What if) what If I never ever took when you said you wanted to go out and hang with your crew?
(What if) what if I was a different man?
(What if) what if I wasn't so selfish and took one second just to listen to you
(What if) what if I was alone? On my own
(What if) what if I wasn't so damn controlling, you would still be right here

[Chorus]
We would still be together, be together, be together right now [3x]
We would still be together, we would still be together girl

(What if) what if I didn't have lame excuses for all the stuff that I do?
(What if) what if I had no baby mommas, no damn drama and I never were around you
(What if) what if never called out your name and treated you like you were my queen
(What if) what if I woke up from this madness and this shit was just a dream
(What if) what if I really went to work and spent a whole day creeping?
(What if) what if you were at the beauty shop and you didn't here about me last week?
(What if) what if you ever asked me a question and I didn't stut-stut-stutter all of the time?
(What if) what if I wasn't so damn controlling, you would still

[Chorus]

(What if) what if I never said I do when I do that I wasn't ready for you
(What if) what if I gave a damn to my church and did to get off in the VIP

[Chorus]

We would still be together girl
<E>

Tsk, why you gotta act like that?

When I say that I love you
You ask me what I want?
When I try to care for you
You say I'm tryin' to front

And when I try to listen to you, oh baby
You take it as a joke
And when I try to give you good advice, yeah, yeah
You swear that I don't know

You can't hurt me no more, yeah
So I'm walkin' out that door
Said, you can't hurt me no more
So I'm walkin' out that door
<E>
<S>
Is it me,
Who never compromise,
I only see things through my eyes,
Which means is my way?
Or is it you
Who's always shutting down,
Never wanting to talk about the problems we got?

Or is it we to blame for all that's going down?
I say that I love you but we can't work it out.
It's making us not want to stay around.
We need to sit down and ask ourselves.

Why can't we (why can't we)
Why can't we get along
When we know we can't be away from each other for long?
Why can't we (why can't we)
Why can't we get along
When at the end of the day we know we gotta come home?

Why can't we (why can't we)
Why can't we get along
When we know we can't be away from each other for long?
Why can't we (why can't we)
Why can't we get along
When at the end of the day we know we gotta come home?

Tell me
Why can't I look at you
And see your point of view
And take the back seat?
Is it true
That I'm so unreasonable
And I don't know how to love
Even though God sent to me to you?

Or is it we to blame for all that's going down?
I say that I love you but we can't work it out.
It's making us not want to stay around.
We need to sit down and ask ourselves.

Why can't we (why can't we)
Why can't we get along
When we know we can't be away from each other for long?
Why can't we (why can't we)
Why can't we get along
When at the end of the day we know we gotta come home?

Why can't we (why can't we)
Why can't we get along
When we know we can't be away from each other for long?
Why can't we (why can't we)
Why can't we get along
When at the end of the day we know we gotta come home?

I just can't sit and watch us go at each other this way.
'Cause you know like I know we're better than this.
Girl, I've tried everything in my heart but it's weighing to be more than just your man.
'Cause you deserve the best.
Together we're the best.
We just can't throw it away.

Why can't we (why can't we)
Why can't we get along
When we know we can't be away from each other for long?
Why can't we (why can't we)
Why can't we get along
When at the end of the day we know we gotta come home?

Why can't we (why can't we)
Why can't we get along
When we know we can't be away from each other for long?
Why can't we (why can't we)
Why can't we get along
When at the end of the day we know we gotta come home?

'Cause you know I love you, and I know you love me
Can we, can we baby?
Oh, why can't we get along, when we both know that this is home?

Why can't we (why can't we)
Why can't we get along
When we know we can't be away from each other for long?
Why can't we (why can't we)
Why can't we get along
When at the end of the day we know we gotta come home?
<E>
<S>
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin about
Sounds real dramatic, like somethin's comin
Got that real intro type vibe to it
Yeah
Enough of this smooth
Its bad boy, baby

We go by the name of q, mike, slim, daron
And this is part three
You know, like the third album
Like the third time we been here
Like part three
And oh yeah, they represent the atl
Come on

Just a little 12 is all you need
Just a little 12 is all you need
Just a little 12 is all you need

Let's do it.

All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying

And you
Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow?
Set this place on fire
'Cause I'm tired of your lie
All I needed was a simple "Hello"
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry

(I) I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
(And you) You leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out, over you
Cryin' over you, yeah

Never wanted to see things your way
Had to go astray
For why was I such a fool (why was I such a fool)
Now I see that the grass is greener

Is it too late for me to find my way home
How could I be so wrong?
Leaving me all alone
Don't you know my tears will cause an inferno
Romance of the flames
Why should I take the blame?

You were the one who left me neglected (So sorry baby)
Apology not accepted
Add me to the broken hearts you've collected

(I) I gave you all of me (Gave you all of me)
How was I to know
You would weaken so easily
(I) I don't know what to do (I don't know what to do)
Now I'm all cried out (All cried out)
Over you

(I) I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you
You left me so confused
Now I'm all cried out
Now I'm all cried out
Over you
<E>
<S>
2000, 2000

And we won't stop, 'cause we can't stop. no we won't stop, 'cause we can't stop

I heard you got plenty of money
Plenty of clothes
An escalade a porche
And a house on the hill
A platinum watch
Platinum rings
Platinum cars
A condo in Beverly hills
And they say that your a millionaire
But baby I don't really care
'cause I just want for you see that all I want is you

I heard you got Gucci belts to match ya boots
Versache wear, Chanel, and Fendi suits
Purple light Benz, purple light Lexus coope
And you make sure ya friends are bout it too
And you say that your a millionaire
But baby I don't really care
'cause I just want you to see that all I want is you

[Chorus]
All, I really want is you
Believe it,'cause what, I say, is true
Not interested in what you do
'cause all I really want is you

I heard you got
Sexy eyes, sexy lips, sexy feet
You got sex appeal
The way you wear your hair
The way you dress
And girl the way you make me feel
Makes me want you more and more
Your everything I'm lookin for
And I just need for you to see that all I want is you

Baby I love your personality
I think your everything a woman should be
Like a picture out of a magazine
Or a vision from my wildest dreams
Make me want you more and more
Your everything I'm lookin for
And I just need for you to see that all I really want is you

All, I really want is you
Believe it, 'cause what, I said is true
Not interested in what you do
'cause all I really want is you
(repeats 5x)
<E>
<S>
When I look into your eyes I see you're lonely
Won't you come with me
I wanna know from you
If ever you needed someone
Could you call on me
Let me touch you, let me hold you
Let me squeeze you
Give your love to me
Baby, stop wasting time
And let's get together, baby

Let me show you
Can I get to know you
Baby let me give you
All my love

Can't believe, you want to leave, me so cold.
All i really, wanted was, to be with you, baby.
I can't imagine ever living life without you,
I'll do anything for you.
Chorus:
Cause I'm all turned out, I don't what to do.
I feel so down and out, wish somebody'd tell me,
Hurry up and tell me, what love is all about.
Girl, you're driving me crazy, and can't see you baby,
You can't leave me alone. I'll do anything for you.
Anything for you.
But there is, nothing I, would not do.
I'd travel across the seven seas, to be with you, baby.
Just believe, that I can make your wishes come true.
Cause I'll do anything for you.
Cause I'm all turned out, I don't what to do.
I feel so down and out, wish somebody'd tell me,
Hurry up and tell me, what love is all about.
Girl, you're driving me crazy, and can't see you baby,
You can't leave me alone. I'll do anything for you.
Anything for you.
So many times I wonder, just how love could be so,
Good to me, all I that I know, is when it comes to you,
There are no limits, nothing that I won't do for you.
(Wish somebody'd tell me, Girl, you're driving me crazy,)
(And can't see you baby. Girl, I'll do anything for you.)
(Anything for you.)
Cause I'm all turned out, I don't what to do.
I feel so down and out, wish somebody'd tell me,
Hurry up and tell me, what love is all about.

Anything for you.

Here we are all alone
You and me, privacy
And we can do anything
Your fantasy
I wanna make your dreams come true
Can you hear?
She's calling me
Between your legs
Loud and clear
I wanna talk back to her
Make love to her
I wanna hear you scream my name

We can make love in the bedroom
Floatin' on top of my waterbed
I'm kissing you
Running my fingers through your hair
In the hallway making our way beside the stairs
We can do it anywhere
I can love you in the shower
Both of our bodies dripping wet
On the patio we can make a night you won't forget
On the kitchen floor
As I softly pull your hair
We can do it anywhere, anywhere

I love the way your body feels
On top of mine so take your time
We got a night
Girl, you know
I like it slow
And I know you like it too, baby
Please don't stop I feel it now
You feel it, too
You're shivering
Ooh, you put me close to you
Just let it flow
There's no other place to go

We can make love in the bedroom
Floatin' on top of my waterbed
I'm kissing you
Running my fingers through your hair
In the hallway making our way beside the stairs
We can do it anywhere
I can love you in the shower
Both of our bodies dripping wet
On the patio we can make a night you won't forget
On the kitchen floor
As I softly pull your hair
We can do it anywhere, anywhere

Z too hot to stop
So we goin' from the bedroom to the floor
Let you know a nigga miss you when out on tour
When our tongues touch
Have a playboy sing it much
Roll a Dutch, let me tell you it turns me on
When 112 sing to you
What kinda feeling do it bring to you?
I bump hard till you say I'm being mean to you
I know the ice Roley gleam to you
A true player's what I seem to you
And if you want it
We can do it in the Black 500
Wit' the top down
In overdrive when we ride cause I'm hot now
You got me goin', I don't think I wanna stop now
Z feinin' like a criminal on lockdown
So let's get a way to get away
You gettin' hot baby, please don't melt away
I got a crib on the beach in Palmetto-way
And here's your personal key to see me everyday
112

We can make love in the bedroom
Floatin' on top of my waterbed

Looking for true love
But now I found that love in you
No longer have to sleep around

Don't be mad if yo' girl wants to leave with me
It's not my fault yo' girl is really feelin' me
I didn't even know she had a man
She said she didn't have a man
She said she didn't want a man
So don't hate me

It's a shame, but this game baby
I got it in me, ain't no lame when it comes to women
I'm all up in 'em
Sing a song, take 'em home, make 'em moan, then I'm gone
It's really just a game to me

It's a rule I shouldn't have to play
I see the same things everyday
Do her wrong she's gonna play
I guess that's why she's callin' me, callin' me
If she's yo' girl she wasn't yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
Don't be mad

Don't be mad if yo' girl wants to leave with me
It's not my fault yo' girl is really feelin' me
I didn't even know she had a man
She said she didn't have a man
She said she didn't want a man
So don't hate me

How in the hell do you have the audacity
Runnin' up on me tryin' to talk to me
Checkin' me

When you need to be checkin' yourself clown
Keepin' yo' girl from schoolin' around
You call yourself a playa tell me how that sound
When yo' girl is feignin' for me and she want to be down

It's a rule I shouldn't have to play
I see the same things everyday
Do her wrong she's gonna play
I guess that's why she's callin' me, callin' me
If she's yo' girl she wasn't yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
You can't be mad

Don't be mad if yo' girl wants to leave with me
It's not my fault yo' girl is really feelin' me
I didn't even know she had a man
She said she didn't have a man
She said she didn't want a man
So don't hate me

Girl never seen a dude this down and dirty
Thuggin' but he thought handle business but he not
Plenty women always want to hold him just cause he rollin'
Claimin' they ain't got no job
But petty niggas they be comin' at you bogus while you clubbin'
Try to take you for the women that be fuckin'
Talk about how he always huggin'
Hope I don't have to hit him with the chrome oven
But just because a playa steady ballin' people steady talkin'
He say she say get you?
I saw yo' girl talkin'
But to 112 and Twista walkin' to the truck bout to get?
No snoozin'
All the bitches be in big ballin' confusion
Niggas trippin' off the ladies they be losin'
Pardon my intrusion
That chick about to have you cruisin' for a bruisin'
Cause there's rules in this game
Playa don't check the pimp, go and check yo' hoe
Give her that good third in a flip flop colored Excursion
For a hit of that blow
Don't try to calm lil' momma down, you know them freak bitches be
Don't get done in like Pretty Tone cause yo' kitty gone
Yo' chick just chose me
You ain't cut like? Tailors
You ain't one of them get higher than helium playas
Or three tone? Gators
You can't never spit fire on no CD and fade us
Lame, greedy instigators
Can't see how you mad just cause she date me
I could never let a girl make me
There's plenty women out here dog so don't hate me

Don't be mad if yo' girl wants to leave with me
It's not my fault yo' girl is really feelin' me
I didn't even know she had a man
She said she didn't have a man
She said she didn't want a man
So don't hate me

Don't be mad if yo' girl wants to leave with me
It's not my fault yo' girl is really feelin' me
I didn't even know she had a man
She said she didn't have a man
She said she didn't want a man
So don't hate me

Sorry I lied to you
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby
Do what you gotta do
I said I'm sorry I
Lied to you
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby
Do what you gotta do

I was always on the phone in the bathroom
You were always in the kitchen at the sink
Girl I was always tryna find a way to tell you
I'm havin' relations and it's gettin' kinda deep
Now even though we've been together for a long time
Girl you know and I know things are not the same
Before we go on any longer wasting all this time
I gotta let you know I'm bout to make a change I'm...

Sorry I lied to you
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby
Do what you gotta do
I said I'm sorry I
Lied to you
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby
Do what you gotta do

You were always in the bedroom watchin' tv
I was always downstairs on the couch
While you were always undecided on a movie
I was always tryna get up out this house
And then I noticed how you always went to sleep
When it was
Time for you
To give that ass to me
And then you wonder why a brotha wants to creep
Well it's time to let you know I got someone who feels me

Sorry I lied to you
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby
Do what you gotta do
I said I'm sorry I
Lied to you
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby
Do what you gotta do

Somethings goin' on
Somethings goin' on where did we go wrong
What happened to the love I used to get at home
You be on my mind used to be my dime
Used to spend time talkin' on the phone
But now that things have changed
I'm jumpin' in my range
And rollin' out

Sorry I lied to you
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby
Do what you gotta do
I said I'm sorry I
Lied to you
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby
Do what you gotta do

Everyday, yeah
Oh oh, everyday
This is the real right here
Things ain't always what
They seem check it

People look at us
And say man they got it made
They signed a record deal
And now them boys is paid
But they don't know what
Comes along with it
With all the fame and the
Fortune there's still bull

Cause even though we struggled hard
And gave up everything
Just to make it this far
Some people love us, and
Other people hate us
But we gonna take the haters
Make them our motivators

Cause they don't
Know what we've been through
And none of them could ever
Walk a mile in our shoes
And I got to keep it real
Every record deal ain't a good
Record deal, but I'm a grown man
So I didn't cry about it

Kept my head up, stayed strong
Until I got up out that contract
And I reminisce on what my lawyer
Use to say, but I wanted it so bad
I guess I had to learn the hard way
Everyday, ya

Everyday the pressures of
This game got us goin insane
If it ain't one damn thing it's
Another thing it's another thing
Everyday the pressures of
This game got us goin insane
If it ain't one damn thing it's
Another thing it's another thing

People want to know
What's goin on with one twelve
If they leave, if they leave
Are their records gonna sell
They say that he gave us the hits
Knowin' damn well that we write our own sh

It's not that I'm mad about it
But I gotta clear it up
For those wonderin about it
I think you need to read the credits
Open up the CD dog and read the credits
Cause things ain't always what they seem
So don't believe everything you see on TV

In the videos, I was in a Bentley
And that Bentley in it, belonged to me
My earrings had to be at least five carrots
I had to live up to that superstar status
Stayed on the road had to stay
Doing shows even though I'm going broke
I couldn't let nobody know

Everyday the pressures of
This game got us goin insane
If it ain't one damn thing it's
Another thing it's another thing
Everyday the pressures of
This game got us goin insane
If it ain't one damn thing it's
Another thing it's another thing

People look at us and say
How does it feel on a new label
With a multi million dollar deal?
I'm just glad we stayed together
We put our faith in the lord
And he made things better
Cause he said it in his word
That one day your gonna get
What y'all deserve, wow

Now aren't ya glad we stayed together
Through the good and the bad times
We stayed together
Through the rich and the broke times
Through stormy weather
And hey, now we look back like
Don't you remember

When you couldn't afford that boy
Hey, sunroof top
Chillin' on the scene
With a down south female
Like hey, how ya love that
Twenty four inch rims
Big body Cadillac
And hey, we do it like that

Everyday the pressures of
This game got us goin insane
If it ain't one damn thing it's
Another thing it's another thing
Everyday the pressures of
This game got us goin insane
If it ain't one damn thing it's
Another thing it's another thing

Oh, ninety six to two thousand three
A hundred twelve still keepin together
True friends all around the world
Our music gonna last forever

From ninety six to two thousand three
A hundred twelve still keepin together
All we need is true friends
All around the world

Our music gonna last forever
From ninety six to two thousand three
A hundred twelve still keepin together
All we need is true friends

Living my life without you
Something I don't want to do
So please don't walk away
And leave me all alone
Baby, stay for just a while

[Chorus]
Why can't you stay with me
For just a while
'Cause if you leave
You'll take a piece of me
Why can't you stay
With me for just a while
Boy, you know you have the key to my heart

Oh baby, girl I don't want you to go
You are my heart and soul
The reason that I live
The one that I adore
And I can't stand the thought
Of being by myself
But I can't see myself
Loving no, nobody else

[Chorus]

And when ever you need me girl
I'll be right by your side
I'll always love you
Who can love you
Why won't you stay with me awhile

[Chorus: x2]
<E>
<S>
Oh, baby, girl I, girl I
Got that funny feeling
Oh yeah, yes I do
112, yeah
Cue

Everytime I try to kiss your lips
You turn away
And when I try to hold you near my heart
You just tell me not today

Well the days (well the days)
Grow to weeks (grow to weeks)
And the weeks just add on
And I try to be strong
But I feel that you don't love me
Anymore

Funny feelings, funny feelings
That you don't love me anymore (woah)
Funny feelings, funny feelings
That you don't love me anymore

I find myself sitting by the phone
Waiting for it to ring
And though my mailbox is always full
But from you I never receive a thing

Well I try (well I try)
To just go by the things that you say
But the things that you do
They just tell me that you don't love me
Anymore

Funny feelings, funny feelings
That you don't love me anymore (Oh)
Funny feelings, funny feelings
That you don't love me anymore

Oh baby
Well I try (well I try)
I try to just go by the things (to just go by the things)
The things that you say
But the things, the things that you do
They just tell me that you don't love me, baby
Anymore

Funny feelings, funny feelings
That you don't love me anymore
(I got that funny feeling baby)
Funny feelings, funny feelings
That you don't love me anymore
(You don't love me anymore)

[Chorus]
I can't believe that love has gone away from me
I can't believe that love has gone away
I can't believe that love has gone away from me
I can't believe that love has gone away
(I can't believe you've gone away)

Hours, days and nights I sat and I prayed
Never thought that I would see this day
I didn't think that it could hurt so bad
A broken heart was never meant for me

Lord, let it please rain on my face
So that it could wash away all my tears
If this is the house that love is in let me leave
'cause I don't want to be hurt like this again
I can't believe

[Chorus]

Many times I watched you while you were asleep
With thoughts of living life with only you
If I had read your mind and things could have changed
I'll give anything to be with you again

All I ever wanted was to see your face
And hear your pretty voice from day to day
Now that you've gone I have no reason for feeling that way
I can't believe you've gone away

[Chorus]

When I look back on the times we've shared
Our life was ok, now what else could come down

Don't you know you were my love (my only love)
And I can't believe that you've gone away

[Chorus]
<E>

I Think by 112
He said that you were crazy
He said that you were losin your mind
And that you don't know how to treat a man
But baby you do me just fine
Everytime he comes around
He tells me how you did him wrong
Telling me you broke his heart
But I don't really give a damn about what he says
Cause check this out

[Chorus]
I think (I think) that you're a beautiful woman
And I think (I think) that you deserve a good man
I think (I think) that I could be the man for ya
So baby won't you take my hand
I think (I think) that you're a beautiful woman
And I think that you deserve a good man
I think that I could be the man for ya
So baby (baby) won't you take my hand

He says your disrespectful
And that you don't know how to carry yourself
And now he's tellin me your ghetto
But still I want no one else
I'm really sick and tired of him
And the way that he talks about you
I think I'm gonna tell him (oh yea oh yea) hey i love that woman

[Chorus]

He's always telling me that you're not the one for me
But I see things in you that he would never see
So no matter what he says and baby no matter what he might do
There is nothing and no one that can change my feelings for you oh baby yea

[Chorus]
<E>
<S>
It's goin down tonight?
Baby I love the way, you're
Lookin at me, lookin at me

I want to make sure that you're
Gonna want to come back for more

Baby I can tell, you're
Feelin me, feelin me
Your bodies callin

Hey girl stop playin games
And meet me at the door

Do you want to get down?

[Chorus]

Do you want to get down
Do you want to get down tonight
You can bring your own girl if you like

Cause I'm gonna bring it out of you
All the freaky things inside of you
It's going down tonight
I said it's goin down tonight
Yes, Yes, it's goin down tonight

Regular girl, regular girl
Takin you to places, you've never
Been before, been before

And I ain't gotta pick one, I can have all three

Like, what's happenin ladies, I was seein you choosin

Let's skip the game, cut that out of confusion
I'm tired of talking over all this loud music

Now let's go somewhere where we all can lose it
Listened to my offer and they couldn't refuse it
Got in the two do, started cruisin
We blew dro and they started removing

They wardrobe, they topless now

Touch here, kiss there, no stoppin now
She licked there and got her underwear broughten down

Oh baby?

[Chorus: x 2]
<E>

Numbers in your pocket
I remember when you
Used to throw those things away
Why do you wanna keep in touch now?
Who gave you a reason?
To act so shady

Baby you know
You can call me anytime
Anything you needed I would give it to you
Ooh, that's how much I care for you
You wanna act now
Never call me back now
Turning off your cell phone
Girl you know that ain't cool
Yes I don't understand baby yeah

Baby it's a shame we gotta go through this
We can't even talk
Girl we don't even kiss

We'd be breaking up like this
But it's over now
It's over now

You think that I don't know what's going on
Cause you're always home alone
And I'm always out of town
You need to stop trying to play me
Cause you can't even fade me
I know you're messing around baby

Forgot what love was all about
And the feelings we had from the start
My heart will always be with you, oh

[Chorus 1]
Oh Babe
Ah Darlin
Oh Babe
My My Sweet Babe
[Repeat 2X]

[Verse 1]
A man is important
In a scheme of things
He's the King of his castle
And the head of his household
And when you look at a man
You expect him to be a leader
This world belongs to a man
But there is someone else
That I can not leave out
She's the mother of the earth
With out a doubt
Even though were living in

[Chorus 2]
A man's world
Know your living in
A mans world
But it would be nothing
Without the touch from
A woman
[Repeat 2x : 2nd repeat ends in "Yeah" "Yeah" Yeah"]

[Verse 2]
A man is imperative
In the world we live
He's a father to his children
And the head of a nation
And when you look at a man
You expect him to be a provider
This world belongs to a man
But there is someone else
That I can not leave out
She's the mother of the earth
With out a doubt
Even though were living in

[Chorus 2]

A man's world
Know your living in
A mans world
But it would be nothing
Without the touch from
A woman
[Repeat 2x : 2nd repeat ends in "Yeah" "Yeah" Yeah"]

[Bridge]
Now tell me who's the King of his castle
And tell me who wears the pants around here
who's a father to his children
A man like me
Now who would be the queen of the castle
Sitting beside you through the thick and the thin
She's the corner stone of this family
She's the mother of the earth
Even though she living in

[Chorus 2]

A man's world
Know your living in
A mans world
But it would be nothing
Without the touch from
A woman
[Repeat 2x : 2nd repeat ends in "Yeah" " Yeah" Yeah"]

[Chorus 1]

Oh Babe
Ah Darlin
Oh Babe
My My Sweet Babe

<S>
Sitting here thinking about you
And all the things we used to do
I never thought that I would lose you
'Cause you were always my boo
Sitting here wondering where we
Wondering where we went wrong
'Cause now I'm here all alone
Wishing you'd come back home, so tell me

[Chorus:]

Why, why, why did you have to go away
Got me missing you every day
Baby tell me why
Why, why did you have to go away
Got me missing you every day
Every day I'm missing you

I don't understand why you left
Baby what didn't I do
Wasn't I always there for you
And wasn't I good to you
How was I to know something was wrong
Baby, I can't read minds
All you had to do was tell me
But you kept it all inside

Girl I'll never find another
Another one to take your place
'Cause you were so, so good to me baby
And you kept the smile upon my face
And I'm on my bended knee and I'm crying
Won't you come back to me
To me, 'cause you mean the world to me

Why, why, why did you have to go away
Got me missing you every day
Oh tell me why
Why, why did you have to go away
Got me missing you every day
I'm missing you
Why, why go away every day
Why, why go away every day
I'm missing you
Why, why go away every day

Never mind that he don't love you
Never mind that he don't care
I'll give you love the way you want it
Say it's alright and I'll be there
I'll be right there

Should've known it when I saw you baby
Should've never let him call you, baby
No matter how I try
No longer can I hide
The way I feel
That's why I'm asking you

Never mind that he don't love you
Never mind that he don't care
I'll give you love the way you want it
Say it's alright and I'll be there
I'll be right there

Girl I got places I want you to be
And so many things I want you to see
If you'd only put your trust in me
Baby I'll show you love

Oh baby, I want to put a smile upon your face
Oh lady say yes and I'll be where you are
Right there

Never mind that he don't love you
Never mind that he don't care
I'll give you love the way you want it
Say it's alright and I'll be there
I'll be right there

Oh baby, I want to put a smile upon your face
Oh lady say yes and I'll be where you are
Right there

Never mind that he don't love you
Never mind that he don't care
I'll give you love the way you want it
Say it's alright and I'll be there
I'll be right there

Oh baby, I want to put a smile upon your face
Oh lady say yes and I'll be where you are
Right there

Never mind that he don't love you
Never mind that he don't care
I'll give you love the way you want it
Say it's alright and I'll be there
I'll be right there

Got to try my best to reach the lowest low
To a place where no one goes
If you let me taste your soul
I'd let you taste my funky emotions
And I'll cover you with me
In a pool of ecstasy
There's no place I'd rather be
Then with you
Please let me do you again

[Chorus]
Now that we're done, what are you thinkin'
Body's so soft, just can't stop thinkin'
You touch me there, what are you thinkin', ooh
Now that we're done, what are you thinkin'
Body's so soft, just can't stop thinkin'
Here comes the sun, now what are you thinkin', ooh

Lying here on a bed full of trust
Just don't fully cover the lust
Anticipating on the questions I'll ask
Was I strong enough or will I last, I don't know
It's kinda hard to play this right
These feelings that I have inside
Is something that I just can't, can't hide

[Chorus: x2]

Do it again
Can't believe how this feels
The feeling is unreal
I got to know now that we're done
Now that we're done, what are you thinkin'
Can we do it again and again and again and again
112 won't you help me sing it

[Chorus]
<E>
<S>
I thought I told you that we won't stop
I thought I told you that we won't stop
I thought I told you that we won't stop

I thought I told you that we won't stop
I thought I told you that we won't stop
I thought I told you that we won't stop
I thought I told you that we won't stop

Jesus, the Notorious just
Please us with your lyrical thesis
We just chilling, milk 'em, "Top Billin'"
Silk and, pure linen, me and, Lil' Cease
Malibu sea breeze, Dom P's, palm trees
Cats named Pablo in milked out Diablos (that's right)
The williest (what?) bitches be the silliest
The more I smoke, the smaller the Phillie gets
Room 112, where the players dwell
And stash more cash than Bert Padell, inhale
Make you feel good like Tony Toni Tone (feels good)
Dick up in your middle like Monie (yes)
She don't know but she setting up to blow me (yes)
Try to style, flying north with a homey (yes)
Escada, Don Dada, player, stay splurging
Game so tight they call it virgin

Ohhhh I, need to know, where we stand
Do we share this special thing called love
I know I do, what about you
I just can't get enough of your love, I need you in my life

Where do I go, what do I do
I can't live without your love
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel
Like I'm the only one for you

Girl I want, to be with you
No one else, only you
Why can't we just make it happen
Baby, I need you in my life

Every time I'm with you
Never want it to come to an end (Thought I told you that we won't stop)
Always make me so happy
You'll always have a place in my heart, I need you in my life

Where do I go, what do I do
'Cause I can't live without your love
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel
Like I'm the only one for you

Now you can hum all you want to, cum all you want to
Money I'mma front you, girl I wanna flaunt you (that's right)
I'mma always want you when nobody wants you (uh-huh)
If I die now my love'll still haunt you (c'mon)
Mase ain't the one that'll pay for your phone (Mase ain't the one)
Mase be the one that'll take you home (that's right)
Even though I'm not the one that gave you the stone (yeah)
On your days alone I can make you moan
Everybody know I got more bounce than the ounce
Bad Boy get more money than you can count
Why I'm buying things you can't even pronounce
I'd do it to you cats for a large amount
And when the beef come, you no where to be found
While I'll be around 'til the winner is announced (The winner is)
Here you go girl with thousands in ya palms
Why you can't let bygones be bygones (Goodfellas)

Where do I go, what must I do
If I can't live without your love
Thinking of you, makes me feel baby
Like I'm the only one for you

Girl I want to, be with you
No one else, only you
Why can't we just make it happen
Baby, I need you in my life

I thought I told you that we won't stop
I thought I told you that we won't stop
I thought I told you that we won't stop
I thought I told you that we won't stop
I thought I told you that we won't stop
I thought I told you that we won't stop

I'm a player, girl, I thought you knew
When you started messin? around with me
Knew I wouldn't commit to you
?Cause I'm a player and I know you can't see it in my eyes

Everyone says that I'm innocent
And it should come as no surprise
That I'm a player and I really think you need to know
That I can't love you right now, baby
'Cause I need more time to grow

But when I do get ready to settle down
Baby, the first one I'm calling is you
Oh, when I do get ready to settle down
Baby, the first one I'm calling is you
But until then

I'm a player and I've traveled all around the world
I've broken many hearts and it really hurts to say this to you, girl
But I'm a player and it's kinda sad that it has to be this way
But I don't wanna lock you down until I'm ready
So right now, I'm gonna play

But when I do get ready to settle down
Baby, the first one I'm calling is you
Oh, when I do get ready to settle down
Baby, the first one I'm calling is you
But until then

But when I do get ready to settle down
Baby, the first one I'm calling is you
Oh, when I do get ready to settle down

You always said you loved me
Though my mind's right now not sure
You've always been there for me
Though my heart never feels secure
Why can't you take a further step
To let me know you really care
'Cause now I'm feeling driven
Into a love that's not right there

Why do you make me feel this way
Feeling betrayed, feeling pushed away
Why do you make me feel so bad
Feeling so hurt, feeling so sad
What have I done to make you turn
I'm feeling so lost, I'm feeling so burned
If you really cared you'd make a change
So I could feel the pleasure and not the pain

After all I've said
You still have it set in your head
That you don't really care about me
Why can't you seem to believe
That I'm the only one for you
I gave all my love to you
And after all I've done for you
You never say that you love me
The way that I love you

Why do you make me feel this way
Feeling betrayed, feeling pushed away
Why do you make me feel so bad
Feeling so hurt, feeling so sad
What have I done to make you turn
I'm feeling so lost, I'm feeling so burned
If you really cared you'd make a change
So I could feel the pleasure and not the pain

I feel all the pain, hurt so bad, feel so sad
It hurts so bad, it hurts so bad
I just can't take no more baby
Girl make a change
So I can feel the pleasure and not the pain

Why do you make me feel this way
Feeling betrayed, feeling pushed away
Why do you make me feel so bad
Feeling so hurt, feeling so sad
What have I done to make you turn
I'm feeling so lost, I'm feeling so burned
If you really cared you'd make a change
So I could feel the pleasure and not the pain

Baby you're the one for me
How can we get down tonight
No more game lets spend some time
Baby won't you give it to me
Jus give it to me baby

[Chorus]
You don't know what
You do to me
The way you touch baby
([Slim:] Girl I'm tired of playing games are you ready)
I love it when you're on top of it
So spread it
([Slim:] Won't you just give it to me, girl we can do it)

Hot and wet
Girl you make me want to sweat
When you touch me like that
Girl you know I want to give it to you [Repeat: x 2]

[Verse 2:]
Baby now it's getting late
Don't stop now
I can't wait
To show you belong to me
Know how I like it
Take your time
Close your eyes
Let me show you what real love should be

[Chorus: x 2]

[Ludacris:]
Now baby you don't work if you work it
Tweak it twork it
I feel like your every imperfection is perfect
Luda yea what you heard is true

I'll make you do things you ain't even know you can do
Got them weak in the knees 'cause my back is strong
And you wonder why your girls want to tag along
'Cause them birds are jealous

My words are embellish
Plus they heard I kiss every curve and crevice
I'm too hot to handle
I rock your mantle

When I play 112 and light 16 candles
Deep sea fishing in your favorite position
Everytime you moan I pay close attention
Flip 'em like a pancake

Show me something
Or we can bring in your vibrating tongue ring
Lets mountain climb 'til we reach the peak
The technique will make you sweat
But don't sweat the technique

[Chorus until fade]
<E>
<S>
Baby. I wish you would have recognized the love I had for you when it was in my heart.
And when it was there for you, because now you're coming back to me and you recognize the love that was once there, but now I found somebody else, and it's too late. I'm sorry.

You should've known that I loved you
You should've seen it in my eyes
Should've allowed yourself to believe in love and recognize
That my love it wasn't going nowhere
No one but you was in my heart
And I can't believe that you would push true love aside

[Chorus]
Baby
It's too late
You missed out on me
And I'm so sad
Sad that you're gone away
I'm sorry you missed out on me
But it's too late
You let love slip away

And you should have known that I was open
You should've seen it in my smile
Should've allowed yourself to be an adult instead of a child
But you were the one with insecurities
So don't try and put the blame on me
You never knew that my love was really here to stay

[Chorus]

Baby tell me how you let our love fade away
When you knew I cared for you
And baby I loved you
And you never gave me your everything
This love that was meant for you

[Chorus:Repeat x4]
<E>
<S>
Another night and it seems that
You made you cry yourself to sleep
Reminiscing on how it began
You found pleasure in this man
You fell like you'll never leave
For his life now you want to lead

Give me just one chance
Cause I can believe that I can make you smile
I know a thousand times
You sit alone and cry
You don't deserve it
Cause I can believe that I can make you smile

Tranquility the misery
Any day will it ever cease?
Here's my shoulder it's okay to cry
Cause I know how make it right
Cause you feel like you want to leave
For his life now you won't lead
Baby give me one chance

Cause I can believe that I can make you smile
I know a thousand times
You sat alone and cry
You don't deserve it
Cause I can believe that I can make you smile

Whoa
I never never make you cry
So pretty baby dry your eyes
I never never make you cry
I promise baby your to precious
I never never make you cry
So pretty baby dry your eyes
I never never make you cry

Cause I believe that I can make you smile
I know a thousand times
You sat alone and cry
You don't deserve it
I believe that I can make you smile
I know a thousand times
You sat alone and cry
Girl you don't deserve it

I believe that I can make you smile
I never never make you cry
So pretty baby dry your eyes
I never never make you cry
So pretty baby dry your eyes
For ever and ever oh yeah I believe
Oh yeah I believe that
<E>
<S>
Sometimes I stare at the bed
Knowing that no one's there
Something is telling me
That you feel the way I do
I dream of you all the time
Wishing that you were mine
I'm feeling so empty
Hoping you'll think of me
I need ya here tonight

[Chorus]
If I'm all alone
And you're all alone
Ain't nothing wrong
Having someone to hold
Oh, your tender touch
It means so much
It feels so right having someone to hold
It's very plain to see
I want you next to me
Give me your hand and
I'll try to understand
Girl I love you so
I can't let you go
Ain't nothing wrong with having someone to hold

Every now and then
I get to wondering
Are you with someone else
Or could you be by yourself
I turn on the TV
It's a picture of you and me
And I'm going crazy
Cause I miss my baby
I want you here tonight, tonight

[Chorus]

Baby, I love you so
And everything that you have done for me
No one has ever done before

Catch me in the spot, low C's in the drop
About half and ounce, the size of Zip-lock
Knockin' the new One-one-deuce
I wanna (intro)deuce me and my old flame
And his name is Bruce
But blew my eye when his girl drove by
Told me bye then he winked his eye

Threw his jacket out first then BAM! Hit reverse

Oh, baby

And I've never known love like this

You shady? I get shady (shady)
To up your old lady and proposing us to stay still friends

Big house in the hills

So don't be telling your girls my money don't stretch
And don't be sayin that 112 don't make hits
Cause you know I moved up
>From the 5 to the six
When I shift with the radio
I know they gonna like this
Sayin Def Jam is like sayin no stress man
Tv?s and champaign in the stretch Lex man
Pour a glass for yourself and pass it to the next man
Takin trips from Atlanta to the Kamen Islands
Forget your problems, lay back, catch a tan
You know we livin it up, chillin in the sand
Catch me off in the club, spend a couple grand
It?s Un-be-live-a-ble

[Chorus X4]
<E>
<S>
You tell me you're keepin' it real with me
You tell me that I'm the only one
You say you'll never leave me lonely, girl
That was a lie

I never wanna see your face again
I don't even wanna be your friend
Don't wanna be used by you again
So I'm saying goodbye

Girl, I know that you're thinkin'
I'm just playing with your head
And I know you been tossing
And turning in your bed
Trying to figure out the reason
Why I left you all alone
Was it worth you giving up
The greatest love you've ever known

Listen baby

Baby, whatcha gonna do without me
Whatcha gonna do without my love
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you
Whatcha gonna do without me
And everything I used to do for you
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you

Alright
I never shoulda put my trust in you
But I never thought you'd let me down
It seems like you get a thrill out of
Out of making me cry
And baby everybody's seen it but me
Cuz I was so blind I couldn't see
I never really needed your help
I could do for myself

Girl, I know that you're thinkin'
I'm just playing with your head
And I know you been tossing
And turning in your bed
Trying to figure out the reason
Why I left you all alone
Was it worth you giving up
The greatest love you've ever known
Baby, whatcha gonna do without me
Whatcha gonna do without my love
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you
Whatcha gonna do without me
And everything I used to do for you
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you

Baby, can't you see
I want it for you more
Than you want it for yourself
Always there for you
I was there for you, there for you
What ever you needed
You know what I've gone through for you

I was saying bye-bye baby
Now whatcha gonna do
My love is gone, the money gone and the house too
Now how bout you?
Get away from me and let me clear my mind
This is hurtin' me just to visit you one more time
I know you fine but I ain't gonna get distracted by your charm
I figure this is the beginning, you intended some harm
Remain calm, it ain't no reason to drop the ball
you should get 10 points just for being On My Arm
But still, that's the past tense, I was speakin' a then
You asking me 'bout that woman now, it's a negative ten"
I had to catch myself before I tried to make her my girl
Start a family and start to bring kids in this world
See life is like a gun, it can backfire then shoot you.
What's good for the present ain't always good for the future
I shake and shiver, look deeply in the mirrow at myself
Wondering will I make it with someone else
Whatcha gonna do

Baby, whatcha gonna do without me
Whatcha gonna do without my love
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you
Whatcha gonna do without me
And everything I used to do for you
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you
Baby, whatcha gonna do without me
Whatcha gonna do without my love
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you
Whatcha gonna do without me
And everything I used to do for you
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you
<E>
<S>
All the love you've given me
So special seems to be no limit
I'll do anything
There's no boundries to how we can grow
How can I let you know
Girl, let me sit and think, oh

[Chorus:]
Why does the wind blow
Why does the sun shine
Why does the rain fall down on my face
Why does the earth spin
Why do the waters reach the shore
And tell me, tell me why
Why do I love you like I do

Oh, in the past
You were there when I was down
My friends could not be found
Your touch kept me so strong
But our love didn't fade away
Instead it sails inside the sky
That's why I must ask why
I must ask why

[Chorus]

I ask myself the question time and time again
(Baby I love you)
Baby I love you
(Yes I do)
Why did you have to hurt me
And leave me all alone
(Baby I love you)
Oh, baby I love you
Now I'm all alone when I need your love

[Repeat Chorus]
<E>
<S>
I love you
You're my everything
You are the only one for me
Well, well, well
And everything that I do
Is for you and me
So never leave
(I can't breathe without you)
Just stay with me
Oh, 112, tell me

You are the only one for me, baby
And everything that I do
Is for you and me
So never leave
Just stay with me
<E>
<S>
I saw a letter lying on tha floor.
I couldn't help but look inside.
Thought it was something you must've left
Left there for me to find.
All the words were on that page.
All my dreams came true that day
I found,
Your letter
Your letter
It said you loved me but you didn't know the words to say
It said you never knew that you could ever feel this way.
It said you only wished someday that I would feel the same.
In your letter,
Your letter.
I guess it just never occurred to me
That you would feel the way I do.
You kept the sweetest secret from my heart.
You kept those feelings in
No you never showed a sign.
Give me proof to what I find
Inside your letter.
Your letter.
It said you loved me but you didn't know the words to say.
It said you never knew that you could ever feel this way.
It said you only wished someday that I would feel the same.
In your letter,
Your letter.
I was so happy that I almost cried.
To think that you could think of me that way.
It's like it's led my sweetest dream,
And may that dream come true,
I would be with you
Always
I saw a name I didn't recognize.
I felt the tears gone to my eyes.
Seeing that the love that you've been longing for,
Was another love not mine.
No you never showed a sign,
But it was right there in the light,
Inside your letter,
You letter.
It said you loved him but you didn't know the words to say.
It said you never knew that you could ever feel this way.
It said you only wished someday that he would feel the same.
In your letter,
Your letter.
I saw a letter lying on tha floor,
I found your letter
It said
<E>
<S>
It was you, it was me, it was love, it was real, then we touched,
Then we kissed, then we loved da way it feels, it was
Time to spend together leaving all da world behind n I thought it would last
But only time would tell so I waited on time

How could you be so selfish never once did you compromise n you wonder
Why I'm trippin take my hand and close my eyes
It was you who never listened when I tried to talk to you
And you knew something was missing we were running from da truth

Baby you said you would never leave me, said, you always be there for me,
I can't understand da reason, why you, why you
want to play me, you said, you would never me said,
You always be there for me I can't understand da reason, why you, why you want to play me

We were real, we were chill you would tell me how you feel you wanted me
You needed me da only one to ease your mind I was
Caught by surprise when you say you want to leave
But it's cool if you gotta go then go ahead n leave imma be around

How could you be so selfish never once did you compromise n you wonder
Why I'm trippin take my hand and close my eyes it
Was you who never listened when I tried to talk to you
And you knew something was missing we were running from da truth

[2x] Baby you said you would never leave me, said, you always be there for me,
I can't understand da reason, why you, why
You want to play me, you said, you would never me said,
You always be there for me I can't understand da reason, why you, why you want to play me

[2x] We used to be in love and we used to be so good you used to drive me so crazy
That was da time you was loving me like you should back when you were my baby

[2x] Baby you said you would never leave me, said, you always be there for me,

You want to play me, you said, you would never me said,

[Verse 1]
(What if) what if I never slept around,
never cheated on you girl
(What if) what if I didn't break your
heart and never ever ruined your world
(What if) what if I always was a real man,
and faced YOU face to face told you the truth?
(What if) what If I never ever tripped when you said you wanted to go out and hang with your crew?
(What if) what if I was a different man? THAN I WAS
(What if) what if I wasn't so selfish
and took one second just to listen to you
(What if) what if I was alone? On my own
(What if) what if I wasn't so damn controlling,
you would still be right here
[Chorus]
We would still be together, be together,
be together right now [3x]
We would still be together,
we would still be together girl
[Verse 2]
(What if) what if I didn't have lame
excuses for all the stuff that I do?
(What if) what if I had no baby mommas,
no damn drama and I never brought it around you
(What if) what if I never called you
out your name and treated you like you were my queen
(What if) what if I woke up from this madness
and this shit was just a dream
(What if) what if I really went to work
and didn't spend the whole day creeping?
(What if) what if you were at the beauty
shop and you didn't hear about me last weekend?
(What if) what if you ever asked me
a question and i didn't st, st, stutter all of the time
(What if) what if I wasn't so damn controlling
[Chorus]
We would still be together, be together,
be together right now [3x]
We would still be together,
we would still be together girl
(What if) what if I never said I do
when I knew that I wasn't ready for you
(What if) what if I gave a tenth to
my church and didn't drink it UP in VIP
what if,what,what if,what if,what,
what iiiif,what if,what if,what if,what if,
what if if i didn't we would still...
[Chorus]
We would still be together, be together,
be together right now [3x]
We would still be together, we would
still be together girl
(until fade out)
would we still be together girl...

Me and 112 we off in the club
Representing A-T-L in the club
Hollaing at every girl off in the club
Shorty gonna be with me when I dip from the club

Can you handle my stick for me?
Keep it movin' while you kissin' on me
Girl, you're makin' me so ready
When we hit the door, put it on me

We can bounce from the club, back to my car, to my crib we go
Skip the couch, head up the stairs, to my room we go
Go, oh, oh, my room we go
Go, come on, my room we go

What you really wanna do tonight
'Cause it's way too hot in the club tonight?
We can start it in the parking lot
'Cause it's all about you, tell me what you like, come on

Can you handle my stick for me?
Keep it movin' while you kissin' on me
Girl, you're makin' me so ready
When we hit the door, put it on me

We can bounce from the club, back to my car, to my crib we go
Skip the couch, head up the stairs, to my room we go
Go, oh, oh, my room we go
Go, come on, my room we go

We can bounce from the club, back to my car, to my crib we go
Skip the couch, head up the stairs, to my room we go
Go, oh, oh, my room we go
Go, come on, my room we go

When we get to your room, tell me what you gonna do?
I've gotta turn you on, so tell me what you gonna do?
Stop talkin', wastin' time, tell me what you gonna do?
My drop tops in the parking lot, so tell me what you gonna do?

We can bounce from the club, back to my car, to my crib we go
Skip the couch, head up the stairs, to my room we go
Go, oh, my room we go
Go, come on, my room we go

We can bounce from the club, back to my car, to my crib we go
Skip the couch, head up the stairs, to my room we go
Go, oh, oh, my room we go
Go, come on, my room we go

Guess, who's back?
Ain't nobody touching us

Tell me where would I be
Oh, oh
Tell me where would I be
Oh, oh, yea

[Verse 1:]
I remember hard rains and stormy nights
When I couldn't see the road
Headed down the path of destruction
See I couldn't get out of my own way
Should've turned right (but I made a left)
Instead of doing wrong (to myself)
Wanted it all to end
Right Then
That's when a sad good chance came
And it started with you
Thankyou for rebuilding me
Girl where would I be

[Chorus:]
Where would I be
If there was no use
Tell me where would I find
If you wasn't my sky
If you wasn't my strength
Tell me where would I be
Cause girl you brought me through
Heaven and back again
Where would I be

Baby where would I be
(Tell me where would I be)
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2:]
Girl you're my angel
Girl you're my high
Now you're my reason
To live my life
And I'm never going to leave your side
Together we will survive
You've been there for me
Ill be there for you
We'd be growing strong
Like lovers do
(You believed in me
When I wouldn't do it so good)
And almost giving up
That's when a sad good chance came
And it started with you
Thankyou for rebuilding me
Baby where would I be

[Chorus:]
Baby where would I be
If there was no use
Tell me where would I find
If you wasn't my sky
If you wasn't my strength
Tell me where would I be
Cause girl you brought me through
Heaven and back again
Where would I be

[Bridge:]
Your love is unconditional
And would never fade away
No matter where I've been
You've always been there
Through thick and thin
We wont stop
We will fight till the end
To the end
Where would I be

[Chorus:]
Baby where would I be
If there was no use
Tell me where would I find
If you wasn't my sky
If you wasn't my strength
Tell me where would I be
Cause girl you brought me through
Heaven and back again
Where would I be

Where would I be
Where would I be
(Where would I be)
Tell me where would I be
Yea yea yea
Where would I be
To say that I am a good man
As a strong mammoth
Cus girl you brought through
Heaven and back again
Where would I be
<E>
<S>
Biting the hand that feeds you
Lying to the voice inside
Reach out to beg for something
This life is a lesson, take what you're given

Feeding on self destruction
Waiting to explode again
No sign of resolution
This life is a lesson, take what you're given

You don't need direction to find your way
Don't you listen to yourself now and again
Killing time, killing your mind over matter
Stop and listen to yourself now

Bend me before I break down
Dying to be free within
It's not how you'd like to see it
This life is a lesson, take what you're given

Forcing yourself solution
As you fall into line again
When will I find the answers
This life is a lesson, take what you're given

You don't need direction to find your way
Don't you listen to yourself now and again
Killing time, killing your mind over matter
Stop and listen to yourself now

Falling to the ground
Left face down as I recall the mirror's ugly glare
Falling to the ground
Left face down as I recall the mirror's ugly glare

Falling to the ground
As I recall
Oh, as I recall the mirror's ugly glare

You don't need direction to find your way
Don't you listen to yourself now and again
Killing time, killing your mind over matter
Stop and listen to yourself now
<E>
<S>
Mother, mother, can you hear me?
I keep trying just to find me
All I know now
All you show me
Endless questions
Hopeless ending

This bitter pill is pushing me away
And now I feel like there's nothing left to say
And I pretend to look the other way
But in the end, will I be ok?

Father, father, will you be there?
As I cry out silent again
Turning colder frozen deeper
Numb to this dream sleeping within

This bitter pill is pushing me away
And now I feel like there's nothing left to say
And I pretend to look the other way
But in the end, will I be ok?

Before I face another day
Won't you let me stay asleep?
Lost among the dreams that always comfort me
And before I find my feet
Won't you show me what I need?
What I need to walk again.

This bitter pill is pushing me away
And now I feel like there's nothing left to say
And I pretend to look the other way
But in the end, will I be ok?
Will I be ok?
Not ok.
Not ok.
<E>
<S>
Something keeps on pulling me down
And I feel like I'm losing ground
Trying just to find my reasons
And losing sense of what is real
Willing to believe in something
Forgetting to believe in me
Will I find my place in your mind
Or will I fall away in time

Now I'm feeling so far away
And now I'm hating you everyday

Waiting just to see the end
As you follow down that road again
Trying just to find your purpose
You're fading faster everyday
Willing to believe in something
Forgetting to believe in me
Will I find my place in your mind
Or will I fall away in time

Now I'm feeling so far away
And now I'm hating you everyday
(Now I'm feeling)

Now I feel I'm losing time
And yesterday slipped away
But you didn't know
And time and time again
You wanted more that I had to give
To leave me with nothing
I'm waiting and dreaming
Yesterday slipped away
But you didn't know
No more waiting
Let me be

Now I'm feeling so far away
And now I'm hating you everyday
Now I'm feeling so far away
And now I'm hating you everyday
(Now I'm feeling)
So far away, so far away!
<E>
<S>
Step back inside the lie again,
You'll find you're wearing thin.
Killing the sympathy
As you take another swing at me now.
Fighting your inner self again,
Losing to what you feel
Shielded behind the lies that make you feel real
Now

It's over and I don't feel a thing
But you're trying to break the scar again.
Your spirit is bleeding as you grin
But your bridge keeps on burning at both ends.

In your mind, the ending seems to be
So far from what you need
Take back the memories
As you smile to hide the pain from me now
Shut down the curiosity
That brings you here again
No sense of purity
As you try to take the life from me now.

Nothing that you ever say
Could ever possibly erase
All the hateful things you did
And now I'm through with you.
Nothing you could ever say.
<E>
<S>
Desperate and waiting, frozen to the core
Numb to these feelings, needing something more
All I keep thinking is where I need to be
All I can hope for is someone to take me away

Before you go, you promise me something
I need to know; will you leave me lifeless?
Leaving me lifeless

Will I bow down to this life that I live?
Will I find freedom or lose it all again?
All I keep thinking is where I need to be
All I can hope for is someone to take me away

Before you go, you promise me something
I need to know; will you leave me lifeless?
Time moves so slow I'm waiting for something
Waiting for something again

Will I fall away from you?
Feelings that I never knew
And I hope that I never fall away
Will I fall away from you?
Feelings that I never knew
And I hope that I never fall away

Before you go, you promise me something
I need to know; will you leave me lifeless?
Time moves so slow I'm waiting for something
Waiting for something
(Leave me lifeless)
(Leave me lifeless)
(Leave me lifeless)
<E>
<S>
Fear falls hard like rain again
Washing over me
You say nothing will ever change
What do I believe?
You fall deep inside again
Nothing left to see
Weakness fills your heart again
You put it to rest

Forfeit everything
Because you were never strong enough
Close my eyes again
And pray that life will not give up

I try to see your face again
A photograph for me
Your voice calling out again
Nothing left for me
You try to find your place again
Waiting just to breathe
Weakness takes your heart again
You put it to rest

Locked inside again
Locked inside again
Locked inside again

Forfeit everything
Because you were never strong enough
Close my eyes again
And pray that life will not give up
Forfeit everything
Because you were never strong enough
Close my eyes again
And pray that life will not give up

Did you forget about the things I said?
Fight the lies inside your head
Deny those who try to bring you down
Kill the pain and emptiness
Find a love and lose yourself
Without this life you're just a memory

Locked inside again
Locked inside again
Locked inside again

Forfeit everything
Because you were never strong enough
Close my eyes again
And pray that life will not give up
Forfeit everything
Because you were never strong enough
Close my eyes again
And pray that life will not give up
<E>
<S>
Look around and tell me what you see
A place surrounded by the hate
That hides in the shadows
Inside of you, inside of me
What can we ever hope to see
If we're not looking

Don't you want to find your own way home again?
Just leave your hate behind
When will you learn to just be you?
Find your own way
When will you learn to follow through?
Make your own way

Looking for something to believe
I find the answer starts with me
Each time I follow
Inside of you, inside of me
What can we ever hope to be
If we're not trying

Don't you want to find your own way home again?
Just leave your hate behind
When will you learn to just be you?
Find your own way
When will you learn to follow through?
Make your own way
When will you learn to just be you?
Find your own way
When will you learn to follow through?
Make your own way

Find another way to get inside me
Find another way to get inside me
Find another way to get inside me
find yourself
Find another way to get inside me
Find another way to get inside me
Find another way to get inside me
Find yourself

Don't you want to find your own way home again?
Just leave your hate behind
When will you learn to just be you?
Find your own way
When will you learn to follow through?
Make your own way
When will you learn to just be you?
Find your own way
When will you learn to follow through?
Make your own way

(Make your own way, make your own way)
When will you learn to just be you?
(Make your own way)
When will you learn to follow through?
(Make your own way)
<E>
<S>
How does it make you feel when I look away?
Feelings that will never seem to fade
I try to find you
You hold your head up high
I let it all fall down
Do you hear me?

Falling away from this pain
So I can fly high
Oh feeling low
Just let it show
And find the words to say what you mean

Screaming silent fears
Nothing left to say
Lost inside the words that bring you down
You try to find me
I hold my head up high
You let it all fall down
Do you hear me?

Falling away from this pain
So I can fly high
Oh feeling low
Just let it show
And find the words to say what you mean

Find the words to say how you feel inside
Find the words to say how you feel inside
Find the words to say how you feel inside
Find the words to say how you feel inside
Find the words to say how you feel inside
Find the words to say

Falling away from this pain
So I can fly high
Oh feeling low
Just let it show
And find the words to say what you mean
Falling away from this pain
So I can fly high
Oh and I can fly high
Just find the words to say what you mean
<E>
<S>
Stay

I walk to the edge again, searching for the truth
Taken by the memories of all that I've been through
If I could hear your voice then I might be
Okay
I know that I've been wrong but I'm begging you
To stay. Won't you stay?

Will you be here or will I be alone?
Will I be scared? You'll teach me how to be strong
And if I fall down will you help me carry on?
I cannot do this alone.

I wish that I could turn back time just to have
One more chance to be the man I need to be.
I pray you'll understand.
If I could hear your voice I might be okay.
I know that I've been wrong but I'm begging you to stay.
Won't you stay?

I need your hand to help me make it through
Again
Nothing compares to how I feel when I look at
You
You never know, you never know tomorrow
You never know, you never know tomorrow, don't
Walk away

I am not alone I know you're there.
<E>
<S>
I'm sorry for needing
You to carry me
So simple sometimes
When you're standing next to me
You never change
You never stay the same
Like a picture perfect sunrise
Every time with one last song to sing

Take it all away from me
And tell me how you want this to be
I want you I need you
Take it all away from me
And tell me how you want this to be
I want you I need you

A life without you
Made me wonder why I'm here
Until I found you
Nothing ever seemed so clear
You never change
You never stay the same
Like a picture perfect sunrise
Every time with one last song to sing

Take it all away from me
And tell me how you want this to be
I want you I need you
Take it all away from me
And tell me how you want this to be
I want you I need you

I lose myself in everything you say
I lose myself in everything
I never knew that I could feel this way
I never knew that I could feel

Take it all away from me
And tell me how you want this to be
I want you I need you
Take it all away from me
And tell me how you want this to be
I want you I need you

I lose myself in everything you say
(You say, you say, you say, you say)
<E>
<S>
It's a long walk back to reality,
She puts another brick in the wall of shame she made so long ago
Trying to figure out where things went wrong
Searching through all the lies she told.
Somehow she missed out on all the things that
She needed most
Days spent wondering why this life is so cold and
Nothing ever changes

Screaming for attention,
Watch the sun steal yesterday.
Hiding all emotion far away.

Trying to find his self confidence,
Another broken heart behind the painless smile that he shows.
Reminded that yesterday is so far gone
And tomorrow is still a miracle
Somehow he missed out on all the things he needed most.
Days spent wondering why this life is so cruel and
Nothing ever changes.

Tomorrow's still a miracle
<E>
<S>
I hear the words you say to me
I see the way you look at me
I know what's on your mind so
Stand up get up back up now
Just stay away

I know the fear you hold inside
I know what's weighing on your mind
There's nothing you can do so
Stand up get up back up

You're reaching out just to be like me
But you've fallen short
Still you're following me
You had the chance to bring me down
But there's nothing left
So just stay away from me

You can't stand to see my face
To know you'll never take my place
There's nothing you can do but
Stand up get up back up now
Just stay away

I feel the hate you push on me
I see the things that you can't see
I know what's on your mind so
Stand up get up back up

It's not the things you say to me
It's not the things that I believe
You try to bring me down
So stand up get up back up now
Just stay away
<E>
<S>
Alone again again alone
Patiently waiting by the phone
Hoping that you will call me home
The pain inside my love denied
Hopes and dreams swallowed by pride
Everything I need it lies in you

'Cause I'm broken
I know I need you now
'Cause deep inside I'm broken
You see the way I live
I know I know your heart is broken
When I turn away
I need to be broken
Take the pain away

I question why you chose to die
When you knew your truth I would deny
You look at me
The tears begin to fall
And all in all faith is blind
But I fail time after time
Daily in my sin I take your life

All the hate deep inside
Slowly covering my eyes
All these things I hide
Away from you again
All this fear holding me
My heart is cold and I believe
Nothings gonna change
Until I'm whole again
<E>
<S>
As I lie tossing in my bed
Lost in my fears remembering what you said
And I try to hide the truth within
The mask of myself shows its face again
Still I lie time and time again
Will you deny me when we meet again?

And I feel like I'm falling
Farther every day
But I know that you're there
Watching over me
And I feel like I'm drowning
The waves crashing over me
But I know that your love
It will set me free

As I find truth where I found it times before
As I search for your hope
I'm finding so much more
And I try to be more like you
And I deny myself to prove my heart is true

I hear your voice calling
The time has come for me
Inside this life I'm living
There's nothing left for me
My mind is slowly fading
So far away from me
Each time I start crawling
You're there watching me
<E>
<S>
Sometimes I feel like I am so far away
I'm lost inside my thoughts and I don't know what to say
I know I need you now more every day
I push I pull I run so far away

And I'm sick and tired of living this way
Sick and tired of being alone
Sick and tired of running from your love

Sometimes I feel like I am so far away
I'm lost inside my mind won't you help me find my way
And I know I need you now more every day
I push I pull I run so far away

Well I'm sick sick sick and tired baby
<E>
<S>
I need you to feel exactly like I do inside
But I feel so alone again
I try to find a better life
Somewhere far away from here
But I need you to believe in me

But I won't be afraid
Just because you don't need me
I will not be ashamed
Just because you don't believe in anything that I say
Now I turn and I walk away from you

I won't fade away
I won't fade away again

I find you down the road that I have walked before
And I know you're alone again
You try to find a better life
Somewhere far away from here
But I need you to believe in me
<E>
<S>
In my eyes you see the pain
With each lie I take the blame
With each sigh I slowly fall away

You are there when I need you
You sew me up when I bleed through
The endless cloth of lies surrounding me

Everything that I am you have given me
The lessons that I've learned are bringing me home
It's everything that I need
It's all the truth that I believe
Right where I need to be
Just bring me home

I hide in darkness blind to sense
Chasing a dream with false pretense
Help me find the fracture in this dark sky
Everything that I believe is slowly overtaking me
I'm just trying to find my way back home

Endless days are haunting me
Open eyes and I can't sleep
I need this now rescue me
Just bring me home

You can't bring me down
Cause I'm going home

It's everything that I need
It's all the truth that I believe
Right where I need to be
Just bring me home
Endless days are haunting me
Open eyes and I can't sleep
I need this now rescue me
Just bring me home
<E>
<S>
I'm reaching out without a sound
My pride falls to the floor again
Inside my mind I search to find
A place just to call my own

Deep inside your eyes
I am blinded by your love
Still I run so far just to find that
I'm alone again

In my head
I hear you calling me
And I can't run cause there's nothing left for me
When I fall you always follow me deep inside
Deep inside
Deep inside of my head

I just can't last as these feelings pass
Once again I hide the pain inside
The smile wears thin and the lies begin
To bring me down again

When I run I run so far away from you
I hide the pain and all the lies deep inside again
And all my faith I put in you
This time you take it all away

Inside my head

Deep inside
My head
<E>
<S>
I find myself in question again
And I doubt this Love you've given to me
I hope you understand when I say
I need this time to myself
You speak your mind to me again
You force your words so deep within
You try to tell me how to live
But it's my life
I know your open arms too well
Cause I've lost myself there many times before
I need to slowly fall away
Far from the grip you have on me
You speak your mind to me again
You force your words so deep within
You try to tell me how to live
But it's my life
I find these words were never true
I've lost all my respect for you
I need to find my own way
It's my life
I gotta get away
One step away
I gotta get away
Just one step away
I gotta away you're pushing me away
I gotta get away
Well I'm gone
<E>
<S>
When I look into your eyes
I see a lot of hate
Pushing me away
You're haunted by a past
A past that brings you down
So you throw it all away
Again

Just try to find a place deep within your soul
And don't deny the child living deep inside
Open your eyes and find
This life's better than you know
It's in your hands now
Just open up your eyes

Deep inside of your mind
You're forced to believe
That nothing's gonna change
So I take you by the hand
And I lead you to a place
A place of happiness
Like this

Don't throw it away
<E>
<S>
As he raises his hand you begin to understand
That no love is worth the hate that you feel
Now you're running out of pain
And all these feelings feel the same
So you close your eyes and wish it all away

And I lie awake and I try to say
Anything I know just to ease your pain
But you hide away where no one can see
And it's only you that can set you free

Now the time has come again
So you reach deep down within
To find the strength that you have buried there
As you turn to walk away you can still hear him say
You'll never make it in this world alone

You try to fight (you try to fight)
You hide the pain (you hide the pain)
You walk away (never again)
<E>
<S>
Every morning as I wake to another day
I bow my head hit my knees and I begin to pray
I search for answers that I wonder if I'll ever find
Running circles in the mazes deep inside my mind

You always take me to a higher level
Show something that's deep inside
You show me things I never knew

You push me you pull me

You set my soul on fire
You take me so much higher
Higher again
Thank you for it all

Everyday living this life not knowing what it means
Consolation from above fulfilling all my dreams
And as I look across the crowd in their eyes I see
All their troubles and their pain staring back at me

You always take me to a higher level
You show me something that's deep inside
You show me things I never knew
You push me you pull me

You always give the best for me
Lift your hands high right where I can see
You always give the best for me
Lift your hands high right where I can see
<E>
<S>
Lately I've been wandering
Off the narrow path
You've given me so many things that I've never had
And all in all I know it's you that always pulls me through
If you reach deep inside you'll see my heart is true

'Cause I hate the way I feel tonight
And I know I need you in my life
Yes I hate the way I feel inside
And I promise to make the sacrifice

The world I know is pulling me
More and more each day
I feel like the odd man out as I begin to pray
Spiteful eyes are watching me
With everything I do
In the midst of darkness Lord
My spirit calls for you

(You know sometimes deep inside)
I feel like this
<E>
<S>
My heart is beating faster
Can't control these feelings anymore
I've waited long enough
I want it more than anyone
It's time to step up and deliver what you wanna see
My blood is pumping, now this is how it's gonna be

It's 45 minutes of love
I wanna see you push and you shove
I'll show you just how far to go
It's time to lose all our control

So feel it
And I can't control these feelings anymore
Believe it
My heart is racing and I can't seem to get enough
Am I dreaming?
Feels like a drug but I know it's adrenaline
Go
Just feel it
Oh my heart is beating faster

My adrenaline reached its limit
I can feel it taking over me
My head is spinning
And it seems like I can hardly breathe
You get a taste
It's like a drug that you don't wanna leave
So if you want it let me see you put your fist in the air

It's 45 minutes of love
I wanna see you push and you shove
I'll show you just how far to go
It's time to lose all our control

So feel it
And I can't control these feelings anymore
Believe it
My heart is racing and I can't seem to get enough
Am I dreaming?
Feels like a drug but I know it's adrenaline
Go
Just feel it
Oh my heart is beating faster

My heart is beating faster
Can't control these feelings anymore
I've waited long enough
I want it more than anyone
It's time to step up and deliver what you wanna see
My blood is pumping, now this is how it's gonna be

So feel it
And I can't control these feelings anymore
Believe it
My heart is racing and I can't seem to get enough
Am I dreaming?
Feels like a drug but I know it's adrenaline
Go
Just feel it
Oh my heart is beating faster

It's 45 minutes of love

My heart is beating faster

My heart is beating faster
<E>
<S>
You say you know just who I am
But you can't imagine
What waits for you across the line
You thought you had me
But I'm still here standing
And I'm tired of backing down

And I'm here now feeling the pain
Of a thousand hearts
Been to hell and back again
I won't take this

You try so hard to bring me down
You can't break the broken
You still don't seem to understand
It's your turn to see just
How it feels to be me
How it feels to be knocked down

And you're here now feeling the pain
Of a thousand hearts
You've been to hell and back again
You can't take this

Remember
This feeling

How it feels to be alive
Now you see me through my eyes
And we're here now feeling the beat
Of a thousand hearts
Coming back to life again
We can make it

Remember
This feeling
Remember...
<E>
<S>
I came home early to see you
Couldn't wait to hold you
I've been away for so long

But as I walked through the doorway
My heart was shattered
To find that your not alone

[Chorus]
When will I break
Into pieces
It's your mistake
I finally see that
Everything I thought was you was a lie
Now you left love dying
It's in the arms of a stranger

The days just seem so much longer
Now that I'm without you
It never seems to get better

I'll try to hold it together
And I can't wait for
The day that you fade from my memory

[Chorus]

In the arms of a stranger
In the arms of a stranger

When will I break
Into pieces
It's your mistake

Everything I thought was you was a lie
Now you left love dying
It's in the arms of a stranger

[Chorus x2]

I came home early to see you
Couldn't wait to hold you
Your in the arms of a stranger
<E>
<S>
Time, moves slowly while you're gone
I haven't heard your voice in quite some time
But I still see your face
I cannot erase the things you've done
And all the ways you kept me hangin' on

[Chorus]
Now your gone
I've moved on
And I don't feel so sorry
Can't you see I'm bleeding
But I won't bleed anymore
I've held on
For so long
But I had to let you go
At the end of our broken road

I know, it hurts to hear the truth
Well maybe
I was never meant to be with you
And I cannot replace
The tears of disgrace
That run for you
Cause running from the truth is what you do

[Chorus]

You were all I've ever known
And I cannot replace all these tears of disgrace
And I won't bleed for you anymore

[Chorus]

And I won't bleed for you anymore
I've moved on
And I won't bleed for you anymore
I'm bleeding but I won't bleed anymore

I've held on
For so long
At the end of our broken road
<E>
<S>
All the games you play
I won't take the blame

I gave you trust
You spit it out and call my name
I'm taking back what's left from all these

[Chorus]
Selfish things you say
And I won't waste another day
With all the games you play
All the games you play
And I'm so scared of all the ways
You take my confidence away
With all the games you play
All the selfish games you play

I'm alone again
Sure feels good to be home

As I walk away
I know you'll feel the pain
I'm taking back what's left from all these

[Chorus]

I don't know why
And I don't know how
I let you control my inner self
As cold as you are
I'm counting the scars
They're proving to me just who you are
Now I know why now I know how
I'm better off without the

[Chorus]
<E>
<S>
Looking back on everything I've done
I never thought I'd find the one
To share the dreams that only I had seen
Locked in the deepest part of me

I took a chance to lay it on the line
There was nothing left to hide behind
If you never love then you may never lose
And I hope I'll always be with you
Now I'm screaming

[Chorus]
Hey love won't you leave your touch
On this heart that's broken
I can't breathe when you're not here
Hey love won't you lift me up
On the wings that fly higher than the stars
That shine above

Thinkin' back on everything we've done
We watched the waves drown the sun
We shared a dream that both us had seen
And we made it our reality

We found a way to stand the test of time
All of our doubts were left behind
If you never love, then you may never lose
And I hope I'll always be with you
Well I'm screamin'

[Chorus]

If darkness should fall upon our hearts
Remember the dreams from the start

[Chorus]

I can't breathe when you're not here
<E>
<S>
It was You
That showed me who I am
And taught me how to stand
For what I know is real

I was sick of all the pain
Tired of all the shame that I felt
But You showed me a way

To never have a doubt
And always to believe in myself
Now I see

It was You
That showed me who I am
And taught me how to stand
For what I know is real

Now I'm breathing for the first time
And I'm leaving all this behind
I've become what I am because of You
It was You

I'm so sorry 'bout the ways
But I can't take away my past
But You love me anyway

And now I wanna do
Everything for You that I can
Even though it won't erase

The foolish things that I've done
Things that blinded me
But now I see

It was You
That showed me who I am
And taught me how to stand
For what I know is real

Now I'm breathing for the first time
And I'm leaving all this behind
And I'll stand for what I know is real

So how can I make this up to You?
I'll fight and I'll push and I'll strive
Now that I living my life for You

I'll fight and I'll push and I'll strive
Can't You see?

It was You
That showed me who I am
And taught me how to stand
For what I know is real

Now I'm breathing for the first time
And I'm leaving all this behind
I've become what I am because of You
(It was You)

I can see the writing on the wall
As time begins to crawl away from me
And I've become what I am because of You
It was You
<E>
<S>
I feel so alone again
I know that I need you
To help me make it through the night
And I pray that you believe in me
You gave me my strength
To face another day alone

I need you now my friend
More than you know
When will we meet again?
'Cause I can't let go of you

This world brings me down again
I know that I need you
To help me make it through the night
And I know that you're the one for me
You gave me my strength
To face another day
And I know

I need you now my friend
More than you know
When will we meet again?
'Cause I can't let go
I can't let go

As time passes by I find
Things never seem to change
When I feel alone
You bring me back to you

And I need you now my friend
More than you know
When will we meet again?
'Cause I can't let go of you
No, I can't let go
<E>
<S>
Our candle burns away
The ashes full of lies
I gave my soul to you
You cut me from behind

Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide
You're scared of the truth, I'm tired of the lies
'Cause who I am, is where you wanna be

Don't act like an angel
You fallen again
You're no super hero
I found in the end

So lie to me once again
And tell me everything will be alright
Lie to me once again
And ask yourself before we say goodbye
Well goodbye
Was it worth it in the end

You said you were there for me
You wouldn't let me fall
All the times I shared with you
Were you even there at all?

Nowhere to run and no where to hide
You're scared of the truth, I'm tired of the lies
'Cause who I am, is where you wanna be

Don't act like an angel
You fallen again
You're no super hero
I found in the end

So lie to me once again
And tell me everything will be alright
Lie to me once again
And ask yourself before we say goodbye
Well goodbye
Was it worth it in the end

Why'd you have to up and run away
A million miles away
I wanna close my eyes and make believe
That I never found you

Just when I put my guard away
It's the same old story
You left me broken and betrayed
It's the same old story

Don't act like an angel
You fallen again
You're no super hero
I found in the end

So lie to me once again
And tell me everything will be alright
Lie to me once again
And ask yourself before we say goodbye
Well goodbye
Was it worth it in the end

Lie to me once again
It's the same old story
Lie to me once again
It's the same old story

Was it worth it in the end
<E>
<S>
I'm flushing down pills
I'm lost in my will
This has been haunting me way too long
And I can't rewind
I'm suffering kind
I've been abusing way too long
I'm broken, suffocating

[Chorus 2]
I'll close my eyes and I'll drift away
I'll make it through my darkest day
And I'll sing this song at the top of my lungs
Until this dark day is done

Now I am trapped in the way
Of all my mistakes
I've been under for way too long
I'll sit in my shame
My hearts starts to race
The poison lingers in my veins
I'm broken, suffocating

[Chorus 1]

You said I'll never change
You said I never had the strength to break away
But now I've changed
It's time to take the pain and walk away
[Now to walk away]

[Chorus 2]
I'll open my eyes and I'll stay awake
I made it through my darkest day
And I'll sing this song at the top of my lungs
Now that this dark day is done

[Chorus 2]
<E>
<S>
It starts with pain
Followed by hate
Fueled by the endless questions no one can answer
A stain covers your heart, and tears you apart
Just like a sleeping cantor

I don't believe men are born to be killers
I don't believe the world can't be saved
How did you get here and when did it start
An innocent child with a thorn in his heart

[Chorus]
What kind of world do we live in
When love is divided by hate
Losing control of our feeling
We all must be dreaming his life away
In a world so cold

Are you sane
Where is the shame
A moment of time passes by
You cannot rewind who's to blame
When did it start
Is there a cure for your sickness
Have you no heart

I don't believe men are born to be killers
I don't believe the world can't be saved
How did you get here and when did it start
An innocent child with a thorn in his heart

[Chorus]

There's a sickness inside you that wants to escape
It's a feeling you get when you can't find your way
So how many times must you fall to your knees
Never, Never, Never, Never, Never do this again

It starts with pain (with pain)
Followed by hate (followed by hate)

I don't believe men are born to be killers
I don't believe the world can't be saved

What kind of world do we live in
When love is divided by hate
Losing control of our feeling
Were dreaming his life away

What kind of world do we live in
When love is divided by hate
Selling our souls for no reason
We all must be dreaming his life away
In a world so cold, in a world so cold
<E>
<S>
Taking chances
Will they take their toll?
Will you focus or will you lose control

Your eyes are open
Your path is chosen
You cant back down now
Youve come to falling down

And now its time to stand up and take your best shot
You made it
Just take it
This might be your once in a lifetime (take your best shot)
Dont waste it
Or youll be that faceless
Cause its once in a lifetime,
So take your best shot

Second chances
Will they come at all?
Is your mind set to use all self control?
Conscience speaking
That tells you nothing
That certain but certainly some things are worth it

So now its time to stand up and take your best shot
You made it
Just take it
This might be your once in a lifetime (take your best shot)
Dont waste it
Or youll be that faceless
Cause its once in a lifetime,
So take your best shot

Taking chances
Will they take their toll?
Will you focus or will you lose control?
Will you make it?
Will you make it?
Will you make it?
Will you make it?

You made it
Just take it
This might be your once in a lifetime (take your best shot)
Dont waste it
Or youll be that faceless
Cause its once in a lifetime, so take your best shot
Its once in a lifetime, so take your best shot
So take your best shot.

<S>
I see you look at me
With a look in your eyes
Like you've got an enemy in your sights now,
I do not believe
This war will be over until your forced to see just how wrong you are

So you think you know who I am
You ain't seen nothin yet
Back against the wall
Your guard begins to fall
But there's no sympathy
Your the enemy
Your my enemy

Your wanting to believe
I'm scared of what's coming
But I begin to see that your weak
Now, don't show your teeth to me
It won't hide the fears that are growing underneath
Your see-through pride

So you think you know who I am
You ain't seen nothin yet
Back against the wall
Your guard begins to fall
But there's no sympathy
Your the enemy
Your my enemy

(Repeat)

Time and time again
You push me to the end
But I feel better now
So much better now
So much better

Your my enemy
<E>
<S>
Alone I face the sun
The burning has begun
I live to find a way
A never ending faith
My heart is on display
And I long to find a place
For light to shine right through
All of the shadows on my face

[Chorus]
So shine for me and anyone
Cast a shadow on the sun
The light to find my way
I hope tomorrow comes today

Another day goes by
Alone I wonder why
Beginning seems so close
And endings fade away
So difficult for anyone to see
I barely recognize this image of me
I'm trying to hide the scars
All of them blistering on me

[Chorus]
So shine for me anyone
Cast a shadow on the sun
The light to find my way
I hope tomorrow comes today
And I won't be the one
A shadow on the sun
A light to find the way
Because tomorrow comes today

And I have the strength to overcome
I have the will to carry on
I'm not scared to face this world on my own
On my own
Alone I face the sun
The burning has begun
A light is shining through
And it brings me back to you

[Chorus]
So shine for me anyone
Cast a shadow on the sun
The light to find my way
I hope tomorrow comes today
And I won't be the one
A shadow on the sun
A light to find the way
Because tomorrow comes today

I hope tomorrow comes today
I hope tomorrow comes today
<E>
<S>

Searching through my reasons to fight the tide again.
The only thing that works for me is feeling that I can.
I fell for something beautiful that turned into a lie.
I gave my everything to you, you left me here to die.

Welcome to the end.
It's all about to go down.
And I know now
We won't be leaving here the same.
Living in the past,
You know we can't go back.
And you know now
We finally reached our bitter end.

Welcome to the end.

Say I never listen,
I never let you in.
You said you needed more from me.
Any more would be a sin.
Believe me when I say to you "I will never change."
I'll be standing in the fire when it all goes up in flames.

Welcome to the end.
It's all about to go down.
And I know now
We won't be leaving here the same.
Living in the past,
You know we can't go back.
And you know now,
We finally reached our bitter end.

We finally reached the end! [x2]

Searching through my reasons to fight the tide again.
The only thing that works for me is knowing that I can.

Welcome to the end.
It's all about to go down.
And I know now
We won't be leaving here the same.
Living in the past,
You know we can't go back.
And you know now,
We finally reached our bitter end.

Welcome to the end.
(Welcome to the end. - We can't go back.)

Welcome to the end.
You know we can't go back.
And you know now,
We finally reached our bitter end.

We finally reached the end!

I'm not okay but patiently I wait
I sit here hoping that we will be saved
Am I too late or am I just in time?
It's just too dark to see through blinded eyes
And I can't see you walk away
'Cause you're already gone

Because in this dark you are my light
The one that brings me back to life
I won't be okay doing this all alone
'Cause love is always hard find
But without you here lately, I'm blind

I'm awake, I saw you in my dreams
You came to me and never turned away
To be okay, something's gotta change
'Cause with the lights on I still feel the same
I can't see you walk away
Tell me where did I go wrong?

Because in this dark you are my light
The one that brings me back to life
I won't be okay doing this all alone
In this life I have to choose
Between losing me and losing you
It's so unfair I do this on my own
'Cause love is always hard find
But without you here lately, I'm blind

I stumble you don't let me fall
Maybe you love me after all
I'll take whatever brings you back
Nobody makes me feel like that
Please don't ever let me lose your light

In this dark you are my light
The one that brings me back to life
I won't be okay doing this all alone
In this life I have to choose
Between losing me and losing you
It's so unfair I do this on my own
'Cause love is always hard find
But without you here lately, I'm blind
Now I see through open eyes
That without you here lately I'm blind

I'm okay and patiently I wait
<E>
<S>
The blood is in the water
The cuts no longer bring me down
Don't you even bother
I've seen enough to take you down

Love, hate, pride
Bottled up inside
Let it go
I'm gonna let it go

(Bang) I'm feeling super human
(Bang) I'm invincible
I'm bulletproof
(Bang) I'm on a revolution
(Bang) I'm invincible
I'm bulletproof
Don't you know I'm bulletproof

The fight has made me stronger
I could never turn back now
Don't you point the finger
Your words no longer bring me down

I'm finally taking over
The truth has surfaced all around
The days are going under
I have risen up and can't be found

Love, hate, pride
Bottled up inside
Let it go
I'm gonna let it go

(Bang) I'm feeling super human
(Bang) I'm invincible
I'm bulletproof
(Bang) I'm on a revolution
(Bang) I'm invincible
I'm bulletproof
Don't you know I'm bulletproof

[Instrumental]

SUPERHUMAN
REVOLUTION

Love, hate, pride
Bottled up inside
Let it go
Gonna let it go

(Bang) I'm feeling super human

Open your eyes and see what you find
This chance has passed us by
We're lost again
When I come to mind what do you see
A prison or paradise
Honestly I don't want to know

So bury me, bury me down
I dare you to make believe you're better now
I dare you to

I think of the times that I saw you cry
A pain with no alibi
We lost control
But I'd rather die than go through this life
Knowing that I'm to blame
Honestly time won't change a thing

So bury me, bury me down
I dare you to make believe you're better now
I dare you to bury me, bury me down
I dare you to make believe you're better now
I dare you to

All this pain has pulled me under
All this pain has run me to the end

So bury me, bury me down
I dare you to make believe you're better now
I dare you to bury me, bury me down
I dare you to make believe you're better now
I dare you to

Open your eyes
See what you find
<E>

There's a time in everybody's life
When nothing's going right for you
Take a chance
Take a step out on the ledge
Take a good look down
And realize it's all for you

For the night
I'm putting up a fight
I've opened up my eyes
To see a world a I never knew

It's time, time to put the past away
Time to take all of your life's reel
And learn to live again
So alive as you open up your mind
As you break away from everything
All that's stopping you

For the night
I'm putting up a fight
I've opened up my eyes
To see a world a I never knew
Time to fly
Time to kiss your fears goodbye
Tim to take control and realize
This world was made for you

There's a time in everybody's life
When nothing's going right for you
Take a chance
Take a step out on the ledge
Take a good look down
And realize it's all for you

For the night
I'm putting up a fight
I've opened up my eyes
To see a world a I never knew
Time to fly
Time to kiss your fears goodbye
Tim to take control and realize
This world was made for you

Close your my lonely friend
I sympathize but look deep within
Think of your where it begins
It's not the end
It's not the end

Take a step and don't look down
You can turn it all around
Would it change things if you knew
I'm with you
I'm with you

I know it hurts, you're broken inside
But no kind of pain's worth more than a life
Take the first step and breathe in again
It's not the end
It's not the end

Take a step and don't look down
You can turn it all around
Would it change things if you knew
I'm with you
I'm with you

Take a step and don't look down
You can turn it all around
Would it change things if you knew
I'm with you
I'm with you

Take a step and don't look down
You can turn it all around
Would it change things if you knew
I'm with you
I'm with you

I'm with you
Would it change things if you knew
I'm with you

It's so pathetic
In a million ways
What a desperate disgrace
Strung out
So proud
Big mouth
Have we gone too far to change?

Brainwashed
Like Hollywood
Spreading through your neighborhood
Built up
Burned down
Watch out
Now it's gotten in our blood

(Time is running out
It's running out
It's running out)

I feel weak
I feel numb
Had enough of this poison we've injected
Living in this word infected

Out, let me out
Tell me how
We all got so disconnected
Sick of living in this world infected

It's systematic
Livin' in this haze
Sleeping on a live grenade
Blacked out
Face down
No sound
We're blowin' up this place

How long can we endure
When we've tainted all that's pure?
Selfish
High risk
Death wish
What if no one finds a cure?

(Time is running out
It's running out
It's running out)

I feel weak
I feel numb
Had enough of this poison we've injected
Living in this word infected

Out, let me out
Tell me how
We all got so disconnected
Sick of living in this world infected

(Time is running out)

The blood is in the water
The cuts no longer bring me down
Don't you even bother
I've seen enough to take you down
Love, hate, pride
Bottled up inside
Let it go, I'm gonna let it go

Bang, I'm feeling superhuman
Bang, I'm invincible, I'm bulletproof
Bang, I'm on a revolution
Bang, I'm invincible, I'm bulletproof
Don't you know I'm bulletproof?

The fight has made me stronger
I could never turn back now
Don't you point the finger
Your words no longer break me down
I'm finally take over
The truth has surfaced all around
The days of going under
Have risen up and can't be found
Love, hate, pride
Bottled up inside
Let it go, I'm gonna let it go

Bang, I'm feeling superhuman
Bang, I'm invincible, I'm bulletproof
Bang, I'm on a revolution
Bang, I'm invincible, I'm bulletproof
Don't you know I'm bulletproof?

Superhuman!
Revolution!

Love, hate, pride
Bottled up inside

You say you love me
Then burn me again
Its so easy to let you in
Now Im standing at the end again

You lifted me up
Youre tearing me down
I dont know where to go from here
Feeding the rage that hides within
You have finally locked me in
Will you ever let me go?

Pretty poison youre in my veins
Go away, go away
I dont need you anymore

You trap me, you haunt me, you trick me again
Youre the reason I always give in
You have pushed me to the edge again

You lifted me up
Youre tearing me down
I dont know where to go from here
Feeding the rage that hides within
You have finally locked me in
Will you ever let me go?

Pretty poison youre in my veins
Go away, go away
Wont you leave me for just one day?
Just one day?
Pretty poison youre in my veins
Go away, go away
I dont need you anymore

Leave me alone, leave me alone
All the voices inside my head
Leave me alone, leave me alone
All the voices inside my head

Pretty poison youre in my veins
Go away, go away
Wont you leave me for just one day?
Just one day?
Pretty poison youre in my veins

Everybody's going psycho

Lights go out
It's finally going down
You feel it in the air
It's going to leave hypnotized
I feel so alive
Let's live life like we're going to die
Join me if you dare we're going to leave the rest behind

Everybody's going psycho
Hands up, don't turn it down
Lose it to the sound
We can finally let it go
Everybody's going psycho

To see the other side
One last chance to step across the line

Psycho eyes
Leave you paralyzed
Lock all the doors there's no place left to hide
I feel so alive

Losing all control
I can feel in my soul
We can finally let go
Everybody's going psycho
Hands up, don't turn it down
Lose it to the sound

Your spell on me is so contagious
We're you sent here to save me
Somehow it feels so right
I back up all of my bags to find a better way
I say goodbye to my fears and walk away
To you I say

In my head, in my head
The darkness waits for another day
The light you bring me
It always seem to just shine on me
And I'm not scared, I'm not scared
I feel you here when you're far away
The light you bring me
It always seems to just shine on me
You're all I need

The angels sing speaking through to you
Were they sent here to save me
Alone you fill the room
The darkness rises again and than I turn away
The pain comes crashing down and I walk away
To you I say

In my head, in my head
The darkness waits for another day
The light you bring me
It always seem to just shine on me
And I'm not scared, I'm not scared
I feel you here when you're far away
The light you bring me
It always seems to just shine on me
You're all I need

All these fears running through my head
Uncovering bones from what was once dead
All this time I could never find
A twisting, turning alibi
Will you cripple me
Will I cripple me

In my head, in my head
The darkness waits for another day
The light you bring me
It always seem to just shine on me
And I'm not scared, I'm not scared
I feel you here when you're far away
The light you bring me
It always seems to just shine on me
You're all I need

All I need
Just shine on me
All I need
Just shine on me

And I'm not scared, I'm not scared
The darkness waits for another day
The light you bring me
It always seem to just shine on me
You're all I need

The mask youre wearing is hardly you
The lies youre preaching are nothing new
Your taste is precious
But your heart is growing cold again
The spell is tempting but your wishes seem to fold again
(Your wishes seem to fold again)

Ive always wanted someone like you
How can I love if I hate all of you?
You disappoint me; I see right through
How can I love if I hate all of you?

You speak your visions; I see right through
Your false intentions; far from the truth
Your taste is precious
But your heart is growing cold again
The spell is tempting but your wishes seem to fold again
(Your wishes seem to fold again)

Ive always wanted someone like you
How can I love if I hate all of you?
You disappoint me; I see right through
How can I love if I hate all of you?

My heart is coming down now
But Im not starting over
I cant wait a moment longer
Ive done the best I can

Ive always wanted someone like you
How can I love if I hate all of you?
You disappoint me; I see right through
How can I love if I hate all of you?
<E>
<S>
I wish that we could start over
And change everything that went wrong
It's hard to stay sober
When you feel like love is gone
We both need forgiveness
And we both need to forgive
For the past that hangs above our heads
And drives us to the end

All these things
I should have done
All the times
I try to run from you

If I fall from the ledge
I don't want to die with regrets
I see the ground coming
I'm not going to run anymore
I could make my amend
I swear I won't fail you again
I was ready to die
Until I saw you suffering
And that changes everything

Pieces go together
The images burn in my mind
Everything seems much clear
For this place I can't recognize
Oblivious to the ending
Your shame has covered my eyes
I'm haunted by my feelings
Imprisoned by my denial

All the things
We should have done
All the times
I try to run from you

If I fall from the ledge
I don't want to die with regrets
I see the ground coming
I'm not going to run anymore
I could make my amend
I swear I won't fail you again
I was ready to die
Until I saw you suffering
And that changes everything

Standing on top of the world looking down
Looking down
Searching for something we haven't found
Haven't found

If I fall from the ledge
I don't want to die with regrets
I see the ground coming
I'm not going to run anymore
I could make my amend
I swear I won't fail you again
I was ready to die
Until I saw you suffering
And that changes everything
<E>
<S>
I feel it getting closer
I feel it taking over
Do you feel the same
Yeah I feel the same
The waiting takes forever
It's finally come together
Now it's in my brain
Making me insane

My feet on the ground
My head in the clouds
I'm one step away
Hope I never come down

It's the chill down my spine
The thrill that I need
I can't get enough
It's the one thing, the one thing
The burning inside
That keeps me alive
I can't give it up
It's the one thing, the one thing I need

Feels like a roller-coaster
Running free and off the track
Do you feel the same
Yeah I feel the same
This rush is like no other
A super sonic drive
And I love the way
It's making me insane

My feet on the ground
My head in the clouds
I'm one step away
Hope I never come down

It's the chill down my spine
The thrill that I need
I can't get enough
It's the one thing, the one thing
The burning inside
That keeps me alive
I can't give it up
It's the one thing, the one thing I need

It's the chill down my spine
The thrill that I need
I can't get enough
It's the one thing

It's the chill down my spine
The thrill that I need
I can't get enough
It's the one thing, the one thing
The burning inside
That keeps me alive
I can't give it up
It's the one thing, the one thing I need

The one thing I need
The one thing
The one thing

Nor tear you asunder

Little Johanna girl of my prairie
Help me fill this house with living words
Further up and further in
Let them fly from our lips
Just like birds

All that dark woods from Pakistan
The glory the glory lodged inside
Strive to enter the narrow gate
To the fountain flowin' deep and wide

He will never leave you
My much afraid
He waits patient
In our prayers unprayed

Now stay close to me
In an amongst the trees
I'll carry your shoes child
You run an play beneath the eaves

Our faith will come by the hearin'
A whisper in the leaves
Listen Johanna hear his voice
In the drone of the bees

He will never leave you
My much afraid
He waits patient
In our prayers unprayed
<E>

Nothin' 'round here to me that's sacred
'Cept you, yeah you
Nothin' 'round here to me that matters
'Cept you, yeah you

Every time we meet together
I feel like I'm on fire
Nothin' matters to me
And there is nothin' I desire
'Cept you, yeah you

Nothin' 'round here I care to try for
'Cept you, yeah you
Got nothin' here to live or die for
'Cept you, yeah you

As a kid I'd hear it
In the churches all the time
Make me feel so good inside
So peaceful, so sublime
Now nothin' does remind me
Of that old familiar chime
'Cept you, yeah you

Used to run in the cemetery
Dance and run and sing when I was a child
And it never seemed strange
Now I just pass mournfully by
That place where the bones of life are piled
I know something has changed
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me
'Cept you, yeah you

Nothin' anymore seems to please me
'Cept you, yeah you
Your love hypnotizes me
It holds me in its spell
Everything runs by me
Just like water from a well
Everybody wants my attention
Everybody's got something to sell
'Cept you, yeah you
I'm in love with you

I'm in love with you
<E>
<S>
Is anything as lovely to me
As the truth in love

No debts outstanding

You can take my coat as well
My eyes are yours sister
An my heart, an my heart
In which He dwells

Heard the voice of my master callin' me
From deep in the hollow
Said that I must follow Him there yeah

With all them wolves about
Well it's a poor mouth that I wear

My hands are yours my brother
You can take my coat as well
My eyes are yours sister
An my heart, an my heart

Livin' me from hand to poor mouth

With a dream on my arm

An by little hands were led astray

All the boughs bend for us
All the earth awaits thee
All the stones they will cry out
An every tongue confess thee

Oh my dream come an take me quickly
'Fore the struggle take me
Yea lay me down any way you choose
An let the voices of our children wake me

The boughs they all bend for us
All the earth awaits thee
All the stones they will cry out
An every tongue confess thee

An though the word yes it falls on deaf ears
It is spoken just the same
The word it stands
Looks straight at every man
From kings down to the lay

I told it fast an glad
The color of a slow drink
Or so they say
So they say by the light of day
Hidden 'neath their wings
Of black, brown and grey

The boughs they all will bend for us
An all the earth awaits thee
All the stones they will cry out
An every tongue confess thee

An though the word yes it falls on deaf ears
It is spoken just the same
The word it stands
Looks straight at every man
From kings down to the lay

Tonight you've caught your breath
You've lost your American spirit
If only I could catch my death
Just give me long enough to fear it

Her talk ain't like the other girls
She takes my livin' at a glance
We hear the locust rasp back and forth
An through our thoughts the past does dance

Do I waste my time
Yea well you know it
An as I stroll through the room
See my features show it

Feel the hand on my shoulder
It calls me to dwell
Take a breath hard an clear
Like a hammer on a church bell
<E>

Self sent a twister
A tearin' after me
Gonna bust my house to splinters

Held by growth of a tree

An yes I fell upon that rock
I did not die just badly broken
An in time my healing it will come
By the words that He has spoken
Oh yeah
I fell upon that rock

Who is it now that loves you
Strait in the front door
An crooked out the back

On your knees out in your shack

All I need a floorboard
An a wooden shoe
Step aside an let my lady through

Hey foot, straw foot
Low we lay 'em down
Hey foot, straw foot
Up an back around

See the high priest
He took my place
When the judge looks to me
He saw a son's face
Not gonna join you in
Your tower of babble, boy
Tired of that talkin'
I'm sick of that noise

Hey foot, straw foot
Low we lay 'em down
Hey foot, straw foot
Coverin' ground

I am not alone
An looks can be deceivin'
When we get down to it
You're talkin' when you
Should be leavin'
I've been to Nebraska
It reminded me of Spain
All the questions loaded
All my answers same

Hey foot, straw foot
Low we lay 'em down
Hay foot, straw foot
Coverin' ground

Let us not mince our words
let's say it true this time
I need your forgiveness
Just like you need mine
Tell me how it is that
You don't want what He's given
It ain't no sin, son
To be forgiven

Hey foot, straw foot
Low we lay 'em down
Hey foot, straw foot
All over town
<E>
<S>
I am a poor wayfaring stranger
Traveling through a world of woe
Ain't no sickness, toil, nor danger
In that bright land to which I go

I'm goin' there to see my father
Said he'd meet me when I come
I'm only goin' over Jordan
I'm only goin' over home

I know dark clouds gonna gather 'round me
I know my way'll be rough and steep
Yet beautiful fields lye just before me
Where God's redeemed their vigils keep

I'm goin' there to see my loved ones
Gone before me one by one
I'm only goin' over Jordan
I'm only goin' over home

I'll soon be free from earthly trials
This body rest in the ol' churchyard
I'll drop this cross of self-denial
And go singing home to God

I'm goin' there to see my savior
To dwell with him no more to roam
I'm only goin' over Jordan
I'm only goin' over home
I'm only goin' over home
<E>
<S>
Unseen down lane
Come petrified velvet
Close to me
I imagined you some place else
You who told me the truth outside
And so forth and so on
I saw in your face
You did not
Remember mine
Lost in my backwood
You woke and found me there
Setting the woods on fire
Running hard and dirt heavy
Neath the skin of a bear
All my harm
I shall wear

I was happy
I knew it
I clapped my hands
Beyond the pale and beautiful
The sweetest song
The saddest thought
Why has no one woke me
We could not
Please stay
Please stay
Stay as I come clean
I've waited for your noise all day
Beyond the pale and beautiful
We keep down our voices
We keep down our voices
For that is our way

Lost in the backwood
You woke and found me there
Setting the woods on fire
Running hard and dirt heavy
In the skin of a bear
All my harm
I shall wear
<E>
<S>
Ain't none ever seen the face of his foe no
He ain't made of flesh & bone
He's the one who sits up close beside you
An when he's there you are alone
Every man is evil yes an every man is a liar
An unashamed with the wicked tongues sing
In the black soul choir
Yes an no man ever seen the face of my lord no
Not since he left his skin
He's the one you keep cold on the outside girl
He's at your door let him in
O I will forgive your wrongs
Yes I am able
An for my own I feel great shame
I would offer up a brick to the back of your head boy
If I were cain
<E>
<S>
I changed my mind and looked no better
Hard of heart, blind, blind to his higher art
My frustration, my anger in disguise I slip under
I slip under quiet, he spots me anyhow

Chalk up my name, you burn my bridges for me
To a dry and clackin' stalk, I swallow stone
They do not recognize inside with them
The locust has no king

Just noise and hard language
They talk me over but I fade slower on fever
Blessed persistence right under my skin
Blessed persistence

Blessed persistence right under my skin
You burn my bridges for me
To a dry and clackin' stalk
Blessed persistence

Nothing comes to mind
Nothing comes to mind
Nothing comes to mind
Nothing comes to mind

Hey chalk up my name
Right under your skin
To a dry and clackin' stalk

Nothing comes
Nothing comes to mind
Nothing comes
Nothing comes to mind
Nothing comes to mind
<E>
<S>
Just as sure as that suns gonna shine
When he comes at his table I will dine

Just as sure as that dog's gonna whine
In my heart no longer will I pine

Just as sure as by evil you are torn
The sky will open up an an angel blow his horn
An down come Jesus lookin' so fine
Just as sure as that girl she is mine...
An I say

Hey hey hey it's always forever
Hey hey hey it's never or now

I dug a hole an hollowed it out
Yes an I fell in
Oh Lord I'm caught in the cord...
The cord of my own sin

Shoot 'em up cowboy - yeah I got away,
But I been dragin' this chain the whole way...
An I say

Hey hey hey it's always forever
Hey hey hey it's never or now

Oh yea boys I know an I am certain
In your heart of heart ye all are hurtin'
Oh no no no not that name not to me
It's much too hard to get down on my knees
But just as sure as by evil you are torn
The sky will open up an an angel blow his horn
An down come Jesus lookin' so fine
Just as sure as that girl she is mine...
I say...
<E>
<S>
I dug on down - for to see my true love
She is the only - girl I will speak of
Yes I went on down for to get my girl
An' free her from the devil's world
I hear the sound of her heart a poundin'
Fear was the hole boy that she wer' found in
The tears of my lord
Yes they run to the ground
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
Yes I wen' on down for to see my true love
Yeah an' I foun' trouble there
But even so I thank the lord for givin' me
And givin' one so fair
<E>
<S>
Word by word she spoke to me
Neath a mess of bygone linen
She listens as to dry a thousand tongues
My love is thin and thinning

Some cherished flower
Flutters through
Gentle born beloved you
Kindness always
Kindness always

I hear the sound
The sound she's left me
I stood her ground no
They've swayed me

Wrapped tight inside your shawl
We wander round this dingy hall
Softly spoken shaken tree
The ash grove we've come to be

The blood run the blood run away
From arm and leg to a warm heart
All our colors agree in the dark

But no man lives upon that land
Far enough for us to see
I hear your voice
In the hum of this machine

I hear the sound
The sound she's left me
I stood her ground
<E>
<S>
I surely knew it was a trap ye
Yet my hands they would not listen
I shoulda known your word was flap
Comin' out all sweet an drippin'
O so where could I go yes but to the lord
I been to your house an' see what you adore
I left there stiff stiff as a board
Where could I go but to the lord
When will I hurt for heaven's sake
When will I suffer for the sake of heaven
All my love well it is madness
Freely given to you folks with gladness
I will not live and die no not by the sword
I am weak without the joy of the lord
Taste and see that the lord is good
Let's bend our knees like we know we should
We can't see clear our eyes are made of wood
Taste and see boy that the lord is good
<E>
<S>
Don't let your mind do all your walking
Boy you'll stumble every time
That road I seen the devil stalking
Dealin' only with the dyin'

G'on let the door hitem
where my hound dog shoulda bittem
Leave him open, leave em there
I don't care

But baby don't look down
Keep your, keep your arms around me

Then he showed me how he caught ya
Like a fish upon the line
Slow reelin' in he brings you closer
Like a poison that takes its time

Roll over little lady
Back and forth and twice around
You're gonna bleed to get away
There ain't no other way round

But baby don't look down
Keep your, keep your arms around me

Hey, hey little baby
There, there little boy
Where, where little angel
Over here my joy

Hey, hey little baby
There, there little girl
Where, where little angel
Over here my pearl

But baby don't look down
Keep your, keep your arms around me
<E>
<S>
On from here walkin' dreams awake
I think not, I think not
The sky comes king blown in every direction
And of no country, I am straw

It is no mystery
I know my way from here

Iron sharpens iron, crooked wooden and peacock black
I have your feathers slung across my back
I'm not the only one to help you down the hill
My blue knuckles do as they will

It is no mystery
I know my way from here
It is no mystery
I know my way from here

One as precious as the other, they go with me
Today I am not a false conscience, a tyrant
Angels line my pockets, dear

I walk a hutterite mile
Look at me this once
Put an eye to my step, look and furrow
It's only misery, it's only ankle deep

It is no mystery
I know my way from here
It is no mystery
I know my way from here
<E>
<S>
Gotta gal
An she's so fair
Those eyes the blackest hair
Behind those

I gotta gal
An she's so fine
All the boys stand in line
Keep your hands to yourself boy tonight
<E>
<S>
To hell with boys creepin' up slowly
Swingin' them shovels 'round
Diggin' up words of pleasure
From evil hollow ground
Oh an' here's one now girl
The devil is in his eye
You'd better start stirring up soil boy
Or hear e'are you'll lye
Whispered to you in the dark
And I think you heard me say
Let's say goodbye like we said hello
In a friendly kind of way
Ye charlie's neat an' charlie's keen but
David he's a dandy
David he's a nice young man
He feeds the girls on candy
Whispered to you in the dark
And all that sordid gain
Let's say goodbye like we said hello
In a friendly kinda way
Now what I done's my damage
An' what you do is your'n
Y'all got nothin' on me
But I'll take that there
Crown of scorn
<E>
<S>
Are you weary my friends
Of my comin' 'round
Draggin' my chains 'cross your floor
You once had a stained glass look in your eye
Well, not any more
The train moves fast
As I walk this track
Carryin' sin in my sack
Same in the front as it is in the rear
He's taken our stripes on his back
On down to here
I cannot walk if you did not walk
I cannot breathe if you did not breathe
Sin in my marrow
Well this road is so narrow
No I cannot walk
This road is pure clob
On down to here
I figured that I would fall
Ye well I left it all
Sin in my marrow
Ye well this road is so narrow
I cannot walk
My lord this road is pure clob
<E>
<S>
Everybody knows my business in this town
Lips are loose the whole way 'round
Where I go I leave a trail
Hell to heaven don't never fail
Hell to heaven don't never fail

Everybody knows my movement in this town
I chase my tail, yea I'm a fuckin' clown
But to you I dare not speak
My words to you would be worthless an weak
My words to you would be worthless an weak an all

But don't you take no pleasure
I ain't yet kicked the pail

I guess I see you boys later
I saw you see me when I'm down
An my guilty head you we're aimin'
See me in your eyes an I am dead
See me in your eyes an I am dead
<E>
<S>
I see the world through the eyes of an idiot
Talkin' big white trash
Before the girls an boys inside of my soul
They make my path
In the mirror there I see my father's face in glass
I know I am not anyone yet too afraid to ask

I will pawn you my watch
Pawn you my chain
Pawn you my new diamond ring
Pawn you my watch
Pawn you my chain
Pawn you yeah most anything

Get your clogs on the floor
Step up step up step up an do more

Hey little girl is your door still open
The devil still inside
Seen your face he left the place
Took everything inside

Hey by the way I forgot to mention
I let it just slip out
Today is the day of salvation
Ain't a gonna tell no lie

Some through the water
Some through the flood
Some by the fire
But all through his blood
Some through the water
Some through the flood
Some by the bullet
But all through His blood
<E>
<S>
Single girl, single girl

I ain't afraid of your laughin'
Nor afraid of your fist
Come on with it brother
Your sweet betrayal kiss

I ain't a scared of you no more
Nor the scars upon your wrists
These bullets you've been shootin' at me
Yeah, they all fall short an miss
Yea yo ... oh brother

Get your boots on boy an get on out
An make your leavin' quick
This shack you built is on my land
An it's comin' down brick by brick
Yea yo, oh brother

Oh there's a, oh there's a willow
<E>
<S>
Oh come sit down and give me your word
That I'll be a man someday and I'll hurt
These children around me this boy that I am
It's up here for thinkin' and down there for dancin'
Not the other way around

Apples in the summertime
Peaches in the fall
I can't keep the girl I got
I can't keep none at all

Nobody knows how I can swing that sway
How I can creep from the narrow
To the broader way
But I'll do no more talkin'
I'm goin' to town
With my true love's breath upon my neck
And my hands on velvet ground

Apples in the summertime
Peaches in the fall
I can't keep the girl, I got
I can't keep none at all
<E>
<S>
We met in the springtime
When the blossoms unfold
The pastures green
And the meadow gold
Our love was in flower
As the summer grew on
Her love like the leaves
Have all withered and gone
Roses have faded
And there's frost at my door
The bird of the morning
Won't sing anymore
The grass in the valley
Has started to die
And out in the darkness
The whippoorwill cry

Alone and forsaken
By fate and by man
O lord if you hear me
Take hold my hand

Where has she gone to
Where can she be
She may have forsaken
Some other like me
She promised to honor
To love and obey
Each vow a plaything
She threw away
The darkness has fallen
The sky turns gray
The hound in the distance
Has started to bay
I wonder I wonder
What she's thinking of
Forsaken forgotten
Without any love

Alone and forsaken
By fate and by man
O lord can you hear me
Take hold my hand

Alone and forsaken
By fate and by man
O lord can you hear me
Take hold my hand

Alone and forsaken
By fate and by man
O lord can you hear me
Take hold my hand

Please understand
<E>
<S>
I've grown tired, of the words of the single man
Hangin' lifeless on his every word, o man
You don't understand dear man
The little angel held out her hand
Sayin' father, father I love you
O praise Jesus I got her
Ok yeah billy goat an we'll play farm
I didn't mean to spirit stiff you
Nor to do you no harm
You say you've got a bone to pick
Well, there's plenty showin' on me
Come on up yeah bring your temper boy
We'll see, we'll see
Yeah you may be the only one come on son
Bring your blade and your gun
And if I die by your hand
I've gotta home in glory land
<E>
<S>
I see a bad moon rising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightning
I see bad times today

Chorus:
Don't go 'round tonight
Well it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

I hear hurricanes a blowin'
I know the end is comin' soon
I feel rivers overflowin'
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

Hope you've got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye
<E>
<S>
The devil's brand is on my bones
An' from inside the holy ghost groans
Sure as shootin' the undertaker knows
He lays the headstones in endless rows
Ye one an' all we croak like a raven
It's the dead an' the dyin' we're cravin'
Ye one an' all
Follow the man tall
Hear his voice
An' drop to a dead crawl
Hey boy
Look straight at the sun
To the center you make a dead run
You're gonna halfta cut off both my hands
I got pride as big as dixie land
I want to sit where the velvet is red yes an'
Where can I lay this apple core?
I want to drink of the blood that was shed girl
I can't breathe anymore
Ye that's right she's waltzin' out the door
To dandy lions waitin'
Ye that's right she wants more
She's my lady in waitin'
<E>
<S>
I'm diggin' you a shallow grave
An to the sun your face I'll raise
I'm diggin' you a shallow grave
One hundred buzzards buzzin'

I seen death hangin' from the tallest tree
Eyes closed no lookin' back at me
Ye they came an took him in the night
The one who kissed em was greed

O everyone will see
An everyone will know
Boy you reap what you sow
I'm diggin' you a shallow grave

An on your rotten bones I'll raise
Yellow daisies
For my true loves hair
One hundred buzzards buzzin'
<E>
<S>
I seen ya in your red room laughin'
With your shinin' coffee can
So many wrongs all kinds a goins on
Held my head an ran
But I hid and did a bit more lookin'
Saw ya dancin' on the pine porch creakin'
Mouth open an doors down wide
Here's what was inside
I seen what I saw
An these things I do are wrong, that's all
An these tales I tales I tell are tall
Then I climbed up on the big horse strapin'
Put the spur down to blood
He took off 16 horses strong
Left me lyin' in mud
An there I sit until the sun's up shinin'
Yes an black stands my ride
Twenty hands high
An watchin' spookeyed
My hands on his side
<E>
<S>
Wicked, wicked
From the mouth I spout
Oh Lord, don't let these thoughts come out
My knees they knock and my feet they fail
The thoughts I think I see your face turn pale

Take my hand and you will see
The one in the way back
Take my hand and you will be
The one atop the swayback

Your word so pretty
Yes, I love that sound
My heart like a hammer does pound
My breath it leaves me to speak it
My legs they tremble to the ground

Take my hand and you will see
The one in the way back
Take my hand and you will be
The one atop the swayback

Wish I was a bible thumpin' fool
Ye from the old school
A mind as narrow as the road I walk
Always upright when I talk but

Take my hand and you will see
The one in the way back
Take my hand and you will be
The one atop the swayback
<E>
<S>
High fiddle high fiddle low fiddle low
There's a ghost bound in my soul
High fiddle high fiddle low fiddle low
There's a cold blade on my crow
A crooked in my walk a stumble in my talk
Is what I'm after little girl
Metal on the red overcast in head
I'm goin' down an feelin' ill
High fiddle high fiddle low fiddle low
There's a girl that I know
You ain't never had one I don't believe you will
This is your season for standin' still
Metal on the red overcast in head
I'm goin' down an feelin' ill
See boys I've known her from way back
Back when she was dead
Tongues on fire spoke the word
Darkness left her head
Holy my other hand that's a fuckin' joke
Like steel cold knife on the bridge of strife
Were the words I spoke
<E>
<S>
I've grown tired, of the words of the single man
Hangin' lifeless on his every word o man
You don't understand dear man
The little angel held out her hand
Sayin' father, father I love you
O praise Jesus I got her
Ok yeah billy goat an we'll play farm
I didn't mean to spirit stiff you
Nor to do you no harm
You say you've got a bone to pick
Well, there's plenty showin' on me
Come on up yeah bring your temper boy
We'll see, we'll see
Yeah you may be the only one come on son
Bring your blade and your gun
And if I die by your hand
I've gotta home in glory land
Red Neck Reel
Prison Shoe Romp
Are ya listenin' boy the man he hung see
You've heard it said that's what he done for me
Did ya hear that girl the man he calls your name
You best go to him it's he not me can loose your chains
Then we'll commence to walk sometime in prison shoes
We'll walk an walk an walk away our blues
Ida done better
From cradle to coffin
In between there's just too much walkin'
I ain't no odd man out junk hiding junk
I ain't nothin' to speak of
Just put it in the back an leave it off the rack
No I ain't what you're used to
Did ya taste that boy
That blood is as sweet as wine
Yeah I got it on me all the time
We'll do some runnin' too
You me an ruby-lu
Spin black blades an I'll unwind
Just let me go to sleep the lord my soul to keep
Don't talk just keep it on your mind
Can't you see that sun shinin' in your face has the same
He came an took your place
But you don't give a rip an down to hell you slip
You squack and squack boy you lost your grip
<E>
<S>
i'm a rompin' dead boy on a long road

please take it from me
'cause i'm gone for today boys

land on me i'll burn lovely
swoop on down - jus' take off that
singeing singing gown
<E>
<S>
O the sky grey orange
An the walls stained blue
An I laid right down on the golden satin with you
Into sween dark circles of beautiful eyes
I go round
O lord
I go round
Will you tell me once again
Cream white skin
You are my friend
I seen you walkin' and your white hips sway
O girl I will have you no more
To the moan in your voice
Not a charm do you lack
Your skin to touch as a black ravens back
But I cannot go far with these words as they rhyme
As to tell, of the pleasure, your hand in mine
An I pray as I say this song in this way
That your eyes they would close an your head begin to sway
An you'll feel how he heals with his blood on our skin
I am yours lady scrawled an thin
Will you tell me once again
Cream white skin
You are my friend
I seen you walkin' in your husband's way
Girl I will have you more
<E>
<S>
O sinnerman where will you run to?
Sinnerman where will you run to?
Sinnerman where will you run to?
All on that day

Run to the mountain
The mountain won't hide you
Run to the sea
The sea will not have you
And run to your grave
Your grave will not hold you
All on that day

Mountains are falling

All on that day
Run to the Lord

Run to the Lord

And the grave will not hold you
All on that day

The strong man he will kneel down
Whilst angels strip him of cloak and crown
Through bitter lips come vile breath
He is the last one to confess
There will be no pity for him
We must kill him where he stands
No there will be no mercy for him
Nor for any of his clan
Let there be no hesitation
Get a rope an make it quick
Each last breath come from his mouth
I will beat it out with a stick
Pray boy you've no reservations
The word will be carried out
He is the one who brought down the son
Let there be no doubt
There is power wonder workin' power
In the blood of the lamb
There is power wonder workin' power
In the precious blood of the lamb
He's seated on the right hand
<E>
