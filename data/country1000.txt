hey i hit town without a clue
minding my business like i always do
just my luck i ran smack into you

and i never couldve known it would be like this
you got the kind of charm that i cant resist
i figure whats the harm in a little bitty kiss or two

but i fell in love
whatcha want to do that for
oh i fell in love
whatcha want to do that for
i fell in love

took me by surprise put me on the floor
right between the eyes with a two by four
just a little taste and
i fell in love

i was doing fine out on my own
never sitting home by the telephone
i couldnt complain that i didnt have much to do
i was a two fisted woman looking for a fight
had a boy on my left a boy on the right
but you burned me up like a chicken at a barbeque

but i fell in love
whatcha want to do that for
oh i fell in love
whatcha want to do that for
i fell in love

didnt see it coming into view
i was overwhelmed and overdue
i aint gonna sweat it
i fell in love

but i fell in love
whatcha want to do that for
oh i fell in love
whatcha want to do that for
i fell in love

caught me on the blind side unaware
i may be a fool but i dont care
i never knew what hit me
i fell in love

but i fell in love
whatcha want to do that for
oh i fell in love
whatcha want to do that for
i fell in love

trying to visualize whats wrong with me
got me hypnotized i cannot see

why will a man go out and cheat what makes temptation so sweet

with a girl in a bar down the street

you never meant to be that man but last night you held anothers hand

was being so close
and having so much to say
and watching you walk away

and not seeing that loving you
is what i was trying to do

its hard to deal with the pain of losing you
everywhere i go
but im doin it

still harder

her long legs looked like trouble
as she sasheyed through the door
and my mind flashed a warning sign
that i chose to ignore
for the prize i thought i could win
the risk seemed mighty small
the bigger the fool the harder the fall

fell in love in the heat of passion
oh but passion has its price
under all that beauty
beat a heart that was made of ice
god knows as far as i could see she didnt have a flaw
but the bigger the fool the harder the fall

i said a woman to keep
the softer the skin
the sweeter the love
the more bitter the end
well one lesson ive learned that applies to all
the bigger the fool the harder the fall

we went out and we had fun
he made me laugh we danced all night
and i didnt see your face when i was looking in his eyes
thats when i knew
i was over you

i was staying busy trying to keep you off my mind
baby but your memory it put up a real good fight
oh i went out with friends to have a drink or two
they tried to cheer me up there was nothing they could do
i was missing you

but then tonight there with him
it felt so good to feel good again
he took my hand and i didnt mind
and i didnt try to stop him when he kissed me goodnight
thats when i knew
i was over

crying in my pillow
praying that youd come home
waiting for the phone to ring
wondering where it went wrong
wishing i could move on

this is how it seems to me
life is only therapy
real expensive
and no guarantee
so i lie here on the couch
with my heart hanging out
frozen solid with fear
like a rock in the ground
woman you move me
you give me courage i didnt
know i had
you move me on
i cant go with you
and stay where i am
so you move me on
this is how love was to me
i could look and not see
going through the emotions
not knowin what they mean
and it scared me so much
that i just wouldnt budge
i might have stayed there forever
if not for your touch
oh but you move me
out of myself and into the fire
you move me
now im burning with love
and with hope and desire
how you move me
you go whistling in the dark
making light of it
making light of it
and i follow with my heart
laughing all the way
oh cause you move me
you get me dancing and you
make me sing
you move me
now im taking delight
in every little thing
how you move me

subiaco cemetery

his sister she was there too
i saw them look at us standin around the grave
and not a soul they knew

born and raised in pineola
his mama believed in the pentecost
she got the preacher to say some words
so his soul wouldnt be lost

had a friend do me wrong
and it nearly did me in till i caught on
the way to heal a hurt like this
isnt easy but the only answer is

send them love
when your heart is breaking
its the only way to get you past the point of constant aching
surrender all the negative stuff
before the anger eats you up
send them love

when you give in to bitter thoughts
and hatred starts to build its hard to stop
the hardest choice youll ever make
is to take the road few ever choose to take

send them love
when your heart is breaking
its the only way to get you past the point of constant aching
surrender all the negative stuff
before the anger eats you up
send them love

solo

send them love
though its not human nature
to offer up forgiveness when they cut you like a razor
surrender all the negative stuff
before the anger eats you up
send them love
when your heart is breaking
its the only way to get you past the point of constant aching
surrender all the negative stuff
before the anger eats you up
send them love

the inlaws are waiting the games have begun
the cell phone keeps ringing dont answer it hon
the whole things arranged just to aggravate dad
and its amateur day on the old super slab
the kids are strapped down like a half load of pipe
all safe in their car seats they fuss and they gripe
well you cant hardly blame em it must be a bitchcounting the crosses off down in the ditch
this ones got flowers this ones got a wreath
this ones got a name painted down underneath
was the road all iced up were they going too fast
heres five in a circle left from the last holiday
holiday

theres a threetrailer rig just a throwin up spray
not legal to run on this kind of a day
but god damn the smokies and the four wheelers too
stay offa my bumpers or the same goes for you
therell be none for him
he that wants it the most
as he hauls it on out to the oregon coast
no turkey no gravy no zinfandel wine
you just stay over right and well get along fine
hes missing the football missing the fun
hed play with the grandkids but hes off on a run
and some hats on the radio singing his song
but it dont make a damn
hes in for a long holiday
holiday

now granny shes yelling
shes ready to eat
shes havin conniptions
cause they wont take their seats
but shes got em all gathered now under one roof
with her camcorder loaded
shes gonna get proof
but do you have to wear that
well i just dont see why
please pass the potatoesaw eat shit and die
did you hear about ellen shes leaving you know
how bout those packers think itll snow
and the minute its over theyll scatter like quail
off down the freeway in the teeth of a gale
silent and shattered and numb to the core
they count themselves lucky
they got through one more holiday
holiday

the highway patrolman
he stands in the rain
he just lets it run down to soften the stain
of the blood on his pant leg
from working that wreck
and he wont forget it
in time for the next holiday

departing chicago at 
in clean desert camo all baggy and loose
sits an iowa guardsman alone by the gate
the place sure looked different in 

when he traveled with mom first time on a plane
to visit some kin hes forgotten their names
but he remembers the soldiers still in their teensin their spit polished boots and their pressed army greens
with the creases so sharp and their faces so smooth
but their eyes looked so heavy he wondered how they could move
now hes got that same look like his insides are black
hes in his mid forties and he has to go backand he cant even smoke while he waits for his plane
the uniforms different but the mission remains
to do like they tell you dont make a fuss
whys not an issue so dont think too much
you just do what you have to shut up and drive
if you come apart later well at least youre alive
you can get you some help you can deal with it then
and life will be better til it happens again

cause theres something inside us that wont let us bein stalks through our days til its too dark to see
and its damn near as deadly as texans on ice
lord dont they beat all
yall have a nice holiday

stars of our stars
dreams of my dreams
you come to me
singing  the stars of our stars

chorus
the stars of our stars
came up the first day
the moon did set
the sun comes up
and all the stars did disappear

stars of our stars
dreams of my dreams
you come to me
dancing to the stars of our stars

chorus

times at night in the spill of light
you catch a glimpse
you make a start with an eager heart
but it always slips
and then everything shifts

stars of our stars
dreams of my dreams
you come to me
trailing the stars of our stars

when my baby holds me i feel so good

its twelve oclock again and here i am slowly driving home
to nothing but a big ole empty bed and another night alone
before i left this evening i turned the lights down low and chilled some wine
i thought tonight would be the night someone would use that pillow next to mine
i went to church and got down on my knees and softly said a prayer
i listened for an answer but i didnt find it there
i looked in every honkytonk in town and i searched the neon lights
but i cant find an angel to save my life
it seems that everyone i know has found someone to love and settle in
but i aint settled nothing and its killing me time and time again
ive been shot down in flames ive been stood up and ive been frozen out
ive been hurt but never felt as helpless as im feeling now
i went to church
oh i need to find an angel to save my life

when i got the word that our uncle joe died
i did what we all did i sat down and cried
got into my car headed home for the hills
back home to kentucky where the funeral was held

i cried all the way to kentucky
his memory so sweet to recall
uncle joe lived such a good life
love and respected by all
his jokes were the talk of the county
he knew how to make people laugh
i cried all the way to kentucky
and then i smiled all the way back

the preacher said joe was a wonderful guy
and god has a project for him in the sky
his stories are binging the angels a smile
to turn us into new ways to cheer us awhile

joe once brought a skunk into sunday school class
had even made grouchy old deacon jones laugh
he says its been fixed and smells like a rose
all of you good christians turn loose of your nose

i cried all the way to kentucky
his memory so sweet to recall
uncle joe lived such a good life
love and respected by all
his jokes were the talk of the county
he knew how to make people laugh
i cried all the way to kentucky
and then i smiled all the way back

at helloween night no one meant any harm
when the outhouse was purched upon grandpas old barn
i think of those things when i tell joe goodbye
a smile on my lips and a tear in my eye

i cried all the way to kentucky
his memory so sweet to recall
uncle joe lived such a good life
love and respected by all
his jokes were the talk of the county
he knew how to make people laugh
i cried all the way to kentucky
and then i smiled all the way back

i cried all the way to kentucky

ever ever after

storybook endings fairy tales coming true
deep down inside we want to believe they still do
and a secret is taught its our favorite part of the story
lets just admit we all want to make it too

ever ever after
if we just dont get it our own way
ever ever after
it may only be a wish away

start a new fashion wear your heart on your sleeve
sometimes you reach whats realest by making believe
unafraid unashamed
there is joy to be claimed in this world
you even might wind up being glad to be you

ever ever after
though the world will tell you its not smart
ever ever after
the world can be yours if you let your heart
believe in ever after

no wonder your heart feels its flying
your head feels its spinning
each happy endings a brand new beginning
let yourself be enchanted you just might break through

to ever ever after
forever could even start today
ever ever after
maybe its just one wish away
your ever ever after
ever ever ever after

ive been dreaming of a true loves kiss
ooh
for ever ever after

mama never seemed to miss the finer things of life
if she did she never did say so to daddy
she never wanted to be more than a mother and a wife
if she did she never did say so to daddy
the only thing that seemed to be important to her life
was to make our house a home and make us happy
mama never wanted any more than what she had
if she did she never did say so to daddy

he often left her all alone but she didnt mind the staying home
if she did she never did say so to daddy
and she never missed the flowers and the cards he never sent her
if she did she never did say so to daddy
being took for granted was a thing that she accepted
and she didnt need those things to make her happy
and she didnt seem to notice that he didnt kiss and hold her
if she did she never did say so to daddy

one morning we awoke just to find a note
that mama carefully wrote and left to daddy
and as we began to read it
our ears could not believe it
the words that she had written there to daddy

kawliga was a wooden indian standin by the door
he fell in love with an indian maiden over in the antique store
kawliga too stubborn to ever let it show
so she could never answer yes or no

he always wore his sunday feathers and held a tomahawk
the maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday hed talk
kawliga too stubborn to ever show a sign
because his heart was made of knoty pine

poor ol kawliga he never got a kiss
poor ol kawliga he dont know what he missed
is there any wonder that his face is red
kawliga that poor ol wooden head

kawliga was a lonely indian never went nowhere
his heart was set on the indian maiden with the coal black hair
kawliga just stood there and never let it show
so she could never answer yes or no

and then one day a wealthy customer bought the indian maid
and took her oh so far away but ol kawliga stayed
kawliga too stubborn to ever show a sign
because his heart was made of knoty pine

poor ol kawliga he never got a kiss

maybe shell look like terry clark or faith hill or somebody
hm hope this aint a party line
here we go

haha is laid up na house watchin cmt
thought id have a late night snack
so i headed to the kitchen on a commercial break
when supm called me back

it was the sexiest voice that id ever heard
comin out of my television set
said call now you can hear me live
and ill tell ya bout my naughtiness

so without hesitation or further ado
i grabbed a hold of my visa
and dialed the number flashin on my screen
sheila

you can tell it all to me
im your phone fantasy
sheila

oh man ah
so i kicked back the recliner
and on the second ring
she whispered hello this is sheila
your credit card number please

i said how much will it cost
for this here trip to paradise
she said you cant put a price on love
thats another  minute went bye

after an hour of conversation
she had me chewin on the receiver
well i worked up a sweat is out of breath
over sheila

you can tell it all to me
im your phone fantasy
sheila

like a man possessed i dialed her number
mornin noon and night
and slowly but surely we fell in love
as my phone bill shot out of sight

after so many costly heart to hearts
i just had to meet her face to face
she wouldnt give me her home address
so i had her number traced hehe

well i thought itd lead to a passion palace
some penthouse in the sky
and i must admit i was a little let down
when i found her in a double wide
a double wide

that beauty that i envisioned
that goddess that drove me crazy
answered the door with a cigar in her mouth
and weighin in at over two eighty heheho

they say love conquers all well i reckon its true
even when its for a fee
we said i do and now were one
though she makes two of me

and she talks to me no charge
every time she takes a breather
and ill never have to work
as long as all you jerks dial
sheila

you can tell it all to me

well you wouldnt read my letters if i wrote you
you asked me not to call you on the phone
theres something ive been waiting for to tell you
so i wrote it in the words of this song

you never knew there were honky tonk angels
or you might have known id never make a wife
you walked out on the only one who ever loved you
so i went back to the wild side of life

now the glamor of the good life always lead me
to the places where the wild liquor flows
i tried to be your one and only angel
but im not that kind of angel heaven knows

i cried so hard the day you went and left me
cause some things you said they cut me like a knife
what you wanted was another kind of angel
and you should be back to the wild side of life

no well i guess im just a honky tonk angel
i might have known id never make a wife
well you left the only one who ever loved you
and im back here on the wild side of life

im only a honky tonk angel
i might have known id never make a wife
you walked out on the only one who ever loved you
and you left me here on the wild side of life

you can almost feel it in the air an american prayer

theyre gonna be alright theyre gonna carry on
help from above will come back strong
i got faith in us i got faith in him
the clouds will part and the sun will shine again amen

it echoes through the factories up in michigan
it bounces off the levees and rides out on the wind
clear out to california and back on up to maine
it dont matter if youre rich or poor a sinner or a saint
every night everybody everywhere
is praying their american prayer

theyre gonna be alright theyre gonna carry on
help from above will come back strong
i got faith in us i got faith in him
the clouds will part and the sun will shine again amen

wasnt to run the till at dairy queen
she always knew if her wishes came true
shed be singing on the opry stage with whos who
but somehow life got in the way
and she never did get to see that day

shed be standing backstage at all my shows
she always taught be to be myself
and i dont know how to be anything else

jumping in with both feet
i know it wouldnt always be easy

i had to follow that voice
wherever it leads
im gonna do my best

and trying to ignore
that it was never me
youre looking for

there seems to be no answer
all is lost of love
when being who you are
is not enough

i am still who i am
the one you called your own
but now your tender ways
have turned to stone

there seems to be no answer
all is lost of love
when being who you are
is not enough

no there seems to be no answer
all is lost of love
when being who you are
is not enough not enough

how sweet and happy seem those days in which i dream
when memory recalls them now and then
and with what rapture sweet my weary heart would beat
if i could hear my mother pray again

if i could hear my mother pray again
if i could hear her tender voice as then
how glad i would be it would means so much to me

ive spent my life looking for you
finding my way wasnt easy to do
but i knew there was you all the while
and its been worth every mile

chorus
so lay down beside me
love me and hide me
kiss all the hurtin of this world away
hold me so close that i feel your heartbeat
and dont ever wander away

mornings and evenings all were the same
and there was no music till i heard your name
but i knew when i saw you smile
now i can rest for awhile

soon the dawn will come and youll be on your way

until the darkness sheds its veil
therell be blue shadows on the trail

well come gather around me friends of mine
while i sing to you about a minstrel band
of children in their witches hats
painting pictures with the pipes of pan

how a young boy and his sister played some tunes
upon a whistle made of tin
and led me through the flower gardens
laughing at the postmans stubby chin

and in my dizzy stupor
i was trying to forfeit all id known
and listen to that music that could swirl me in a magic all its own

but somewhere in the distance
you and i we fought our monsters to a draw
it was in those days of books and wine
with ferlin getty grasping for a straw

and out along the highways
we journeyed far to find that mystic smile
chasing down identities
my god we must have run a million miles

so we can teach the children
nothing nothing but survival in the desert bare
they can teach us how to laugh
how to love and tie bright ribbons in our hair

so sing for us you children
tinkle bells and rhyme the purple greens and blues
think of us as fighting fools
who wintered through our seasons loving you

think of us as fighting fools
who wintered through our seasons loving you
cause you can teach us how to laugh
how to love and tie bright ribbons in our hair

and he who was righteous
loomed radiant striding
behind the lords messenger up the black hill

spoke within her
it is not too late you may look on it still
upon the vermilionstained
towers of sodom
you spun in that court and
you sang on that square
that house whose tall windows
confront you with blankness
once knew you a bride
you bore your sons there

she turned tobehold it and
pain was her master
her eyes yearning toward
it could no longer see
saltwhite grew her body
the blood in it withered
firm earth held her feet that
would never go free

and is there not one who
would weep for this woman
or one who would find her
loss bitter to brook
alone in my heart uneclipsed unforgotten
is she who gave over her life for one look

why do you treat me as if i were only a friend
what have i done that makes you so diffrent and cold
sometimes i wonder if youll be contented again
will you be happy when you are withered and old
i cannot offer you diamonds or mansions so fine
i cannot offer you clothes that your young body crave
but if youll say that you long to forever be mine
think off the heartaches the tears and the sorrow youll save

when you are weary and tired of another mens gold
when you are lonely remember this letter my own
dont try to answer though ive suffered anguish untold
if you dont love me i wish you would leave me alone
while i am writing this letter i think of the past
and of the promises that you are breaking so free
but to this world i will soon say my farewells at last

i had never even been outside the county line
unless you count the million times i left inside my mind
in my day dreams i could see
the way the luck would shine on me
when i finally found the wings to fly
as my mama helped me pack my suitcase
she said you know i love you and ill say it once more anyway

so youll know what to do if your greener grass turns blue
if your sunny sky turns gray
sometimes you gotta run
to see just what youre running from
here at home therell always be place for you
if your greener grass turns blue

i had tears in my eyes and a ticket in my hand
to give to the man at the station
i was so afraid that mama would say
something to make me want to stay
but all she did was look at me and smile
she said i believe that you can make your dreams come true
but most of all i believe in you

so youll know what to do if your greener grass turns blue
if your sunny sky turns gray
sometimes you gotta run
to see just what youre running from
here at home therell always be place for you

for the girl who said that shell be mine

and theres a picture i see everywhere

i can see her recipe book
and on the table theres her favorite glass
in the dynama afraid do look cause
i will see that leather book
sunday morning she was first to class

i pull up shades i pull up blinds
cause its gone the tie that binds
its broken now but god knows i still care
sometimes love is not too pretty
when you find its gone
i guess now i lose my mind i already lost a home
i walk these halls a hollow man
im tryin to do the best i can
but i cant walk away from yesterday
i try to be a stirin man
and rule her with an iron hand
but somehow too much love come in the way
theres the chair that held the man
that held the girl that held the hand
that wore the ring that i no longer wear

to stop the mind that wants to think

on the top shelf in the closet
in the workshop where he spent his extra time
was a dust wooden box that i had never noticed till that time
and we set on the table and carefully we opened up the top
and stared into the memory
daddy kept inside the box

there was a letter from mamma when she went out to reno
to help her sister out in 
and a flower from hawaii when they went on vacation
it was the first time that my daddy ever flew

and the pocket knife i gave to him on fathers day
years ago i thought it had been lost
we all thought his heart was made from solid rock
but that was long before we found the box

i guess we always knew itbut i love you was hard for him to say
some men show it easy and some just never seem to find the way
but that night i began to see the softer side of some i had lost
i saw the love he kept inside the first time we opened up the box

there was a picture that was takenwhen he and mom were dating
standing by his  ford and the faded leather bible he got when he was baptized
i guess no one understood him like the lord

and the poem that he had written about his wife and children
the tender words he spoke were quite a shock

we all thought his heart was made of solid rock
but that was long before we found the box

ever since you told me we were through
ive been down ive been down
the love you said id find to take your place
never came around never came around
but one of these days ill stand on my own
and ill turn this bleeding heart in to stone

chorus
gonna reach way down inside and find a brand new way to live
got plans to forget about the way you made me feel
gonna walk outside one night and turn your memory loose
and when i do i might even quit loving you
and when i do i might even quit loving you

there was time i thought i knew for certain
youd come home youd come home
but judging from the nights ive spent without you
i was wrong i was wrong
the time has finally come to face the truth
theres only one thing left i can do

but if drinking dont kill me
her memory will

these wild old bones they move slow
but so sure of their footsteps
as i trip on the floor
and i lightly touch down

lord its been ten bottles
since i tried to forget her
but the memory still lingers
lying here on the ground

and if drinking dont kill me
her memory will
i cant hold out much longer
the way that i feel
with the blood from my body
i could start my own still
but if drinking dont kill me
her memory will

she said were much too different
were from two separate worlds
and he admitted she was partly right
but in his hearts defense he told her
what they had in common
was strong enough to bond them for life
he said look behind your own soul
and the person that youll see
just might remind you of me

i laugh i love i hope i try
i hurt i need i fear i cry
and i know you do the same things too
so were really not that different me and you

she could hardly argue
with his pure and simple logic
but logic never could convince a heart
she had always dreamed of loving someone more exotic
and he just didnt seem to fit the part
so she searched for greener pastures
but never could forget
what he whispered when she left

i laugh i love i hope i try
i hurt i need i fear i cry
and i know you do the same things too
so were really not that different me and you

was it time or was it truth
maybe both lead her back to his door
as her tears fell at his feet
she didnt say i love you
what she said meant even more

i laugh i love i hope i try
i hurt i need i fear i cry
and i know you do the same things too
so were really not that different me and you

the wicked king of clubs awoke
it was to his queen turned
his lips were laughing as they spoke
his eyes like bullets burned
the suns upon a gambling day
his queen smiled low and blissfully
lets make some wretched fool to play
plain it was she did agree

he send his deuce down into diamond
his four to hart and his trey to spade
three kings with their legions come
preparations soon where made
they voted club the days commander
gave him an army face and number
all but the outlaw jack of diamonds
and the aces in the sky

he give his sevens first instructions
spirit me a game of stud
stakes unscarred by limitation
tween a man named gold and man named mud
club filled gold with greedy vapors
til his long green eyes did glow
mud was left with the sighs and trembles
watching his hard earned money go

flushes fell on gold like water
tens they paired and paired again
but the aces only flew through heaven
and the diamond jack called no man friend
the diamond queen saw muds ordeal
began to think of her long lost son
fell to her knees with a mothers mercy
prayed to the angels every one

the diamond queen she prayed and prayed
and the diamond angel filled muds hole
the wicked king of clubs himself
fell in face down in front of gold
now three kings come to clubs command
but the angels from the sky did ride
three kings up on the streets of gold
three fireballs on the muddy side

the club queen heard her husbands call
but lord that queen of diamonds joy
when the outlaw in the heavenly hall
turned out to be a wandering boy
now mud he checked and gold bet all
and mud he raised and gold did call
and the smile just melted off his face
when mud turned over that diamond ace

now heres what this storys told
if you feel like mud youll end up gold
if you feel like lost youll end up found
so amigo lay them raises down

on a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
the emblem of suffering and shame
and i love that old cross where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain

so ill cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

oh that old rugged cross so despised by the world
has a wondrous attraction for me
for the dear lamb of god left his glory above
to bear it to dark calvary

so ill cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

in the old rugged cross stained with blood so divine
a wondrous beauty i see
for the dear lamb of god left his glory above
to pardon and sanctify me

so ill cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

to the old rugged cross i will ever be true
its shame and reproach gladly bear
then hell call me some day to my home far away
where his glory forever ill share

the rich got richer and the poor got poorer and to me it didnt seem right

then ill wash my face in the morning dew bathe my soul in the sun

hard road under the night sky

verse 
the sea came in and washed me out
the way was carved in ice
the tokens of a buried past
the shavings of a heavy life
the wind blows each and every way
its not for me my heart to steer

the river flows the whole

the fires moved my heart so far
now colours cant be seen
the distant call of faroff stars
haunting oer what might have been
and all an ending was begun
come with me cross the caretrod floor
come with me to the holy song
and with times passing to the core

hard road under the night sky
keep on travelling fare thee well my love
hard road under the night sky

she knows how and she knows when
shes born to die and live and again
she goes from moor to build a nest
she knows the dance that burns her best
from the ashes fair to share
the purest sounds to leaden heads
sung from her best and bends the old trees
wingd wind songs sung so holy

chorus
hard road under the night sky
keep on travelling fare thee well my love

he was old school and overalls
tough as nails as i recall
he fought a war and came back home
honest as the day was long
and right before my grandpa died
he looked me right straight in the eyes
said heres some words to get you by
to help you on the journey of your life

youll need a hero
and a good dog
especially a good dog
a hammer and a handsaw
a bandaid now and then
youll need a home to come home to
son we all need a refuge
on the straight and narrow path
you need to learn to bend
get a good square keep it level
have grace to face the devil
youll need an angel flying by your side
on the journey of your life

ride the wind til we meet again
on the other side of life
youll need some good luck and a bible
especially a bible
a lot of faith in god above
and a woman you can love
youll need a good song that you can sing on
and a shoulder you can lean on
and you gotta draw the line sometimes when push comes to shove
youll need to lose some to be a winner
and have courage to surrender
youll need to laugh a lot and keep it light
on the journey of your life

and no matter what dreams youre chasing
never get above your raising
and may the simple things be amazing
on the journey of your life

we came up from tennessee
we didnt know much about this city
it had us all in a trance
and all we could do is sing drink and dance

cause youre too too too much fun
and when youre gone clouds cover the sun
the funnest boys we ever met
youre too too hard to forget

you showed up late to the party
yes you were too too tardy
you had whiskey tequila and a bottle of love
and little did you know you fit us just like a glove

cause youre too too too much fun
and when youre gone clouds cover the sun
the funnest boys we ever met
youre too too hard to forget

and hell you are my number one
and hell you are a son of a gun

my heart may belong to you
but im stil gonna dance to 

cause youre too too too much fun
and when youre gone clouds cover the sun
the funnest boys we ever met
youre too too hard to forget

well whats the damn news do you want some more 
we played and we puked on the kitchen floor 
its how you gone and said i love you
its how you gone and said 

cause you are too too too much fun
and when youre gone clouds cover the sun
the funnest boys we ever met
youre too too hard to forget
youre too too hard to forget

it said im gone for good
youre no longer with the best

never dreamed thered ever be

nobody else could move me like you used to
i had to be out of my mind
thinking id soon be over you
but im still crazy and im not over you

when the bad news finally hit me
lord it hurt me to the bone
i was just a fool to think
you could be just a little bit gone

but it would be easy
it wouldnt be hard to forget
little did i know
that i hadnt seen nothing yet

i used to be crazy over you
nobody else could move me like you used to

i was watching your mouth move in and out
in little unexpected ways
not hearing a word that you said in over twenty minutes
on occasion i grunt and give you a knowing stare
focused on what i hope is a pivotal moment
i went to the other house
i got the key from the guard and i let myself in
i knocked on the door twice and rang once
could you watch this for me until i return
all smiles and mariachi
theyre playing the dating game theme
we ordered some cheese dip a tea and two light beers
i feel i should be talking rather saying something
instead of nodding and eating most of the chips
my confidence is returning
im relating and remarking in an improved fashion
so much that i decide to stop on my way home
so much that i decide to stop for donuts on the drive home
i went to the last house on the list
i was relieved to find that my services were no longer required
they were no longer required

her memory was a mountain
as tall as it was wide
it cast a cold dark shadow
across this heart of mine
i tried to rise above it
might have rolled a stone or two

the mountain moved
and i could see
a vision of forever standing right in front of me
the earth stood still
and the light broke through
some miracles only love can do
the mountain moved

i say you smiling at me
i heard you speak my name
you reached out to hold me
and i let go of yesterday
its still there in the distance
but its fading from my view
cause last night for the first time

the mountain moved
and i could see
a vision of forever standing right in front of me
the earth stood still
and the light broke through
some miracles only love can do
the mountain moved

dolly parton

sometimes he gets crazy as men are known to do
hell lose his head in spite of everything he stands to lose
what is it in a man that makes him act like such a fool
she swears she never knew but always needed to

but stubborn pride is just the way of cowboys i suppose
even love cant change the things he ought to change the most
and its pride that keeps him standing when he should be on his knees
makin apologies but she loves him desperately

oh but now and again she wished hed been a poet
so hed know all the perfect lines to say
and have some great romantic way to show it
be the hero ridin up to save the day
and go ridin high like a knight in shinin armor
to sweep her up and carry her away
oh but he dont have no magic ways to charm her
no cause even love cant change a cowboys ways

i love you and im sorry are words that just dont come
cause words like that are no match for the kind that rule his tongue
but his eyes keep tellin her you know i love you anyway
no matter what i say or what i never say

oh but now and again she wished hed been a poet
so hed know all those fancy lines to say
and have some great romantic way to show it
be the hero ridin up to save the day
and go ridin high like a knight in shinin armor
and sweep her up and carry her away
oh but he dont have no magic ways to charm her
no cause even love cant change a cowboys ways

his ways seem cold but she knows hes much warmer
but even love cant change a cowboys ways

hes just a fool that must defend his honor
but even love cant change a cowboys ways

and wake up screaming
when we lay our cold weapons down

faded when i threw my fear away
its not a thing you can imagine

or spend your life with one foot in the grave

on a cold montana morning on the road to idaho
i watched her order hot and black to go
in her boots and spurs and blue jeans
and the lonely in her eyes
told me just how much she loved the rodeos

i asked where she was headin
she said the boise show
she took a third in butte just yesterday

she never has been married
and she probably never will
silver buckle dreams
dont leave time for standing still

round and round and round she goes
where she stops nobody knows
the miles are gettin longer
the nights they never end

oh the rodeos and livestock shows
keep the lady on the go
lord she loves to run those barrels
its the only life she knows

for now on fifteen seasons
the circuits been her home
at times she misses kids she never had

but she wouldnt trade a minute
of the years that shes got in it
shes had herself some happy
shes learned to take the sad

when i looked up from my coffee
i saw boise on her mind
she had that look of leavin in her eyes

as she drove into the morning
it slowly dawned on me
how hard it is to tell a dream goodbye

round and round and round she goes
where she stops nobody knows
the miles are gettin longer
the nights they never end

oh the rodeos and livestock shows
keep the lady on the go
lord she loves to run those barrels
its the only life she knows

on the marquee sign at  and 
the latest movie shows and it starts to snow
children look into the sky
to see if reindeer really fly
who knows
but when it comes down to this season
above it all theres still a reason
to just look up

a star is born tonight
come to make things right
angels singing anthems ringing
glory to the king
a star is born tonight

silent holy night heavens sacred light
shines all around
and joy resounds
in manger hay the baby jesus came to seek
and save the lost
until theyre found
peace on earth a new beginning
hes the gift that keeps on giving
to all of us

a star is born tonight
choir glory hallelujah glory to the king of kings
come to make things right
choir merry christmas to you all the joy the season brings
angels singing anthems ringing
glory to the king
a star is born tonight

angels singing anthems ringing
glory to the king
a star is born tonight

shed be a singlebarrelled
bourbon on ice
smooth with a kick
a chill and a burn all
at the same time

shes sunday drive meets
high speed chase
she aint just a song
shes the whole mix tape
shes so complicated
thats the way god made her
sunshine mixed with
a little hurricane

and she destroys me in that tshirt
and i love her so much it hurts
i never meant to fall like this
she dont just rain she pours
that girl right theres
the perfect storm

i know how to make her laugh
or blush or mad at me
but thats ok there aint no one
more beautiful angry

and she loves just as deep
as she goes when shes down
the highs match the lows
cant have one without the other
and i love her just the way
god made her
sunshine mixed with
a little hurricane

and she destroys me in that tshirt
and i love her so much it hurts

a guy like me spends his whole life
looking for that girl right theres
the perfect storm

look under his floorboards mama
i dont trust his silly grin
hes got a beatup rambler nebraska plates
and i aint getting in
i dont like the way his pinky ring
picks up the dashboard light
or his short little piggy fingers
or the way his belt is cinched too tight

check under his floorboards mama
i dont like his suggestive tone
the way his words drip from his mouth
as he asks can i take you home
i dont care how many miles i got
i think id rather walk them alone
than to sit in the back seat
as his eyes in the mirror
reduce me to flesh and bone

check under his floorboards mama
cause that razors not just a threat to me
hell be slicing tiny crescents from your heart
without laying a sweaty palm to your cheek
dont accuse me of running scared
listen to what im saying
its a fucked up ol world but this ol girl

i almost thought i lost you in dc but in boston
your memory caught up with me
for every mile ive cried a million tears
i keep leavin but youre still here

so if youre wonderin why im standin on your doorstep
its cause you never left im here to ask you for another chance

fall is a feeling

maybe watch a winter day
turn the green water
to white and blue
flyin shoes

is all the hills can do
alone and then
her silver sails again

he said buy a paper mister i said how older are you son

they named me after my daddy but they say i look like my mom
why its almost midnight son you should be home asleep

i know it but i wanted to get me a bicycle
and i gotta help mommy buy somethin to eat
my daddys pretty mean to us

and he spends most of his money for wine
and he dont hold a job like most other men
cause well he gets fired all the time

i said have somethin to eat
arent you hungry
he said i guess a little bit

i believe i have a hamburger and a glass of milk to go with it
i said is that enough

where do you live son
on main street sir
theres six of us livin in one room

theres me and my three brothers and my mommy and my dad
but someday im gonna buy mommy a big house
if i have to turn out bad

my appetite left me
as i sat there watchin him
and i thought hes just one of thousands
thats brought up in a home of sin

where their parents abused their children
and forget to maker the all mankind
and then wondered why theres juvenile delinquency
when they are at fault most of the time

as i watched the little guy leave the cafe
and i wondered how many more children
would be brought up that way

i went to church last sunday
so i could sing and pray
but something quite unusual
happened on that day

now church it started right on time
just like it does without a doubt
and everything was all just fine
except when it came time to let us out

you know the preacher he kept preaching
he told us i have one more thing to say
children before you think of leaving
you better think about the judgment day

now everyone got nervous
because everyone was hungry too
and everyone was wondering
what was the next thing he would do

and the preacher he kept preaching
he said now ill remind you if i may
you all better pay attention
or i might decide to preach all day

and now everyone was getting so hungry
that the old ones started feeling ill
and the weak ones started passing out
and the young ones they could not sit still

and the preachers voice rose higher
so i snuck up on the balcony
and i crept into the choir
and i begged them brothers sisters help me please

i said when i give you a signal
i said when i raise up my hand
wont you please join with me together
and praise the lord i have a plan

and the preacher he kept preaching
long is the struggle hard the fight
and i prayed father please forgive me
and then i stood up and with all my might
i sang

to the lord let praises be
its time for dinner now lets go eat
weve got some beans and some good cornbread
and i listened to what the preacher said
now its to the lord let praised be
its time for dinner now lets go eat

yes and i did give a signal
yes and i raised up my hands
and then joined with me the choir
yes every woman child and man
they sang

to the lord let praised be
its time for dinner now lets go eat
weve got some beans and some good cornbread
and ive listened to what the preacher said
now its to the lord let praised be
its time for dinner now lets go eat

and the preacher he stopped preaching
and a hush the church did fill
and then a great white dove from up above
landed on the window sill

and the dove flew down beside him
and a fork appeared right in his hand
and with everybody watching
the preacher ate that bird right there and then

and now everyone got really nervous
and the preacher he did start to glow
and as we watched in disbelief
these were the words he spoke

he said now mamas in the kitchen
and shes been there all day
and i know shes cooking something good
so lets bow our heads and pray
and he sang

to the lord let praises be
its time for dinner now lets go eat
weve got some beans and some good cornbread
now listen to what the preacher said
he said to the lord let praised be
its time for dinner now lets go eat

and the moral of this story
children it is plain but true
god knows if a preacher preaches long enough
even hell get hungry too
and hell sing

to the lord let praises be
its time for dinner now lets go eat
weve got some beans and some good cornbread
now listen to what the preacher said
he said to the lord let praised be
its time for dinner now lets go eat

or the one in the cage tipped over and fell
and if we lived to see sunday be able to tell
of the terror below and the place we call hell

cause its a shaft that will feed us and the shaft that will kill
our brothers and fathers who die by her will
the fishing is slow and theres work to be done
so ill put on my hat and ill go underground

now i fear for my children i fear for my wife
and if i dont make it back now ive had a good life
for theres a cave in behind us only one way to go
down deep in the shaft so far below

cause its the shaft that will feed us and the shaft that will kill
our brothers and fathers who die by her will
the fishing is slow and theres work to be done
so ill put on my hat and ill go underground

what do you say to a family of one
who dont come back up with the rest
is it better to let them just mourn by themselves
or tell em he was one of the best

theres a flash above head is it fire or light
mcdonell lies seethin the draggers in sight
and a few hours later well be smellin sweet air
with all of our children the stores well share

of the shaft that will feed us and the shaft that will kill
our brothers and fathers who die by her will
the fishing is slow and theres work to be done
so ill put on my hat and ill go underground
so i put on my hat and i go underground

and they planted that willow last fall

and put the lonely message in her hand

down in old southern texas i wandered one day
where the tropical sea breezes blow
i there fell in love with a flower so rare
and they called her the galveston rose

her heart was as true as her blue smiling eyes
and as fair as the lily that grows
and the finest of gold in no way could compare
with the curls of my galveston rose

i grew jealous and falsely accused her one day
said her love i no longer should know
ive been true please believe me her little heart cried
but i left her my galveston rose

little then did i think that sometimes id repay
and would reap every sorrow and care
but as years passed along i grew lonely each day
for the one i had left waiting there

so i wrote to my darling and said i was wrong
ill return dear if youll only wed
but soon came a letter my flower had died
and these are the words that i read

your sweetheart is peacefully sleeping tonight
in a grave where the white violets grow
and enclosed theres a curl a last token of love
and a note from your galveston rose

i was innocent dear though you left me alone
but remember i loved only you
and the lock thats enclosed is a curl from your rose
wholl be waiting in heaven for you

im trying it all the time yeah im out there every night
my truck has seen some miles to find the words to write this song
to get me back on top where i belong but im not over you yet
i must be having fun all wrong

that river run was a whole lot of fun especially when youre with the ones that
bring you so much laughter and good times
but that river it ran so low
that only means you go real slow and you take the time to enjoy the finer things in life
so we showered and shaved in a bathroom stall in a texaco on the way to gruene hall
it was a sold out concert for one of my heroes that night hey i guess im alright
im just a little bit tired tonight getting over you has made a busy man of me

chorus

oh ive seen jerry jeff umpteen times this year
he just keeps getting better everyday i followed robert ear keen
from dallas to the sparkling city by the sea i jumped up on the sea wall and sang corpus christi bay

i have always been on the outside
looking inside till i found you
never knowin where my life would lead
what i could believe till you broke through
where on earth did you come from

its like ive known you all my life because
i have laughed and cried till my tears ran dry
i have lived and died a thousand times
i have won and lost at whatever cost
but through it all its true
i have always loved you

just the way you smile lights up the day
and im blown away just to be with you
the way you touched my life with such tenderness
words cannot express how you pull me through
and if i could do it all again

id still reach for you my love my friend
i have laughed and cried till my tears ran dry
i have lived and died a thousand times
i have won and lost at whatever cost
but through it all its true
i have always loved you

dusty roads and winter time
tonight im thinking of the town
and the one i left behind
to do this rambling round
tonight im drinking while im thinking
until the beer joints close
and im thinking of someone
i called my georgia rose

its on dusty streets we walked
and talked of things to be
and she never laughed or mocked
my wanting to be free tonight im free
to walk these streets
while the wind cuts through my clothes
and im free to dream forever
about my georgia rose

so come to my dreams
sweet as a flower
blooming among the pines
georgia rose
still my desire
once you could have been mine

sometimes a man makes certain choices
and they lead his heart somewhere
sometimes he follows certain voices
and he dont seem to care
oh how i love that little town
down on the eastern coast
and i love that pretty girl
i called my georgia rose

west of rome just east of the border
in a staticy ramada inn
polishing his boots and pummeling his liver
steeped in the dark isolation
just what business does he have around here
credentials are wearing out with each little bit of cheer
yes its a bad scene were convening

brushing his teeth and milking his ulcer
preparing to waste another wily morning
stroking himself and them phoning up his sister
he tells her their life would make one whale of a movie
yes a childhood full of dry goods and wet neglect
the father they now sponge off they have no absorbing respect
yes hes a glad boy to have such a void
yes hes a martyr crawling across cobble stones
from his cozy cottages just west of rome
yes its a sad state for great suffering

paul siebel

those other years the dusty years
we drove the big hers through
i tried to forget the miles we rode
and spanish johnny too
hed sit beside a water ditch when all this herd was in
and hed never harm a child but sing to his mandolin

the old talk the old ways and the dealin of our game
but spanish johnny never spoke but sing a song of spain
and his talk with men was vicious talk
when he was drunk on gin
ah but those were golden things he said to his mandolin

we had to stand we tried to judge we had to stop him then
for the hand so gentle to a child had killed so many men
he died a hard death long ago before the road come in
and the night before he swung he sung to his mandolin

how long have we been the very best of friends
ive always heard you say i could tell you anything
oh the times i made you laugh the times i dried your tears
through the good and bad ive always been right there

an arms length away
right in front of your face
this close to your lips right at your finger tips
that one true love youre dreaming of
darlin what would you say
if i told you its an arms length away

for so long ive longed to hold you oh the nights i almost told you
i stopped myself afraid of just what you might say
and the love that you have searched for that seems so out of reach

boy let me tell you what

boy but give the devil his due
i bet a fiddle of gold against your soul
cause i think im better than you

the boy said my names johnny and it might be a sin
but ill take your bet youre gonna regret
cause im the best theres ever been

johnny rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
cause hells broke loose in georgia and the devil deals the cards
and if you win youll get this shiny fiddle made of gold
but if you lose the devil gets your soul

the devil opened up his case and he said ill start this show
and fire blew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
and he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss
then a band of demons joined in
and it sounded something like this

when the devil finished johnny said
well youre pretty good old son
but sit down in that chair right there
and let me show you how its done

fire on the mountain run boys run
the devils in the house of the rising sun
chicken in the bread pan a picking out dough
granny does your dog bite no child no

the devil bowed his head because he knew that hed been beat
and he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at johnnys feet
johnny said devil just come on back
if you ever want to try again
i done told you once you son of a bitch

and learned what it was for
so you made a list of shoulders
that youd be needing

well mine arent yours anymore
come on show me your temper
be the man i remember
so i wont forget what youve done

weather man says its gonna rain tonight
the kind of storm where the basement floods
and you lose the lights should have thought of that before
cause im not your blue sky anymore

dont wanna be that blue sky
im not your blue sky anymore

momma never seemed to miss the finer things in life
if she did she never did say so to daddy
she never wanted to be more than mother and a wife
if she did she never did say so to daddy

the only things that seemed to be important in her life
was to make our house a home and make us happy
momma never wanted anymore than what she had
if she did she never did say so to daddy

he often left her all alone
she didnt mind the stayin home
if she did she never did say so to daddy
and she never missed the flowers
and the gifts he never gave her
if she did she never did say so to daddy

being took for granted was a thing that she accepted
and she didnt need those things to make her happy
she didnt even seem to notice
that he didnt kiss and hold her
if she did she never did say so to daddy

one morning we awoke
just to find the note
that momma carefully wrote
and left to daddy
and as he began to read it
our ears could not believe it
the words that she had written there to daddy

she said our kids are old enough
and they dont need me very much
so ive gone in search for love i need so badly
i have needed you so long
but i just cant keep holdin on
she never meant to come back home
if she did she never did say so to daddy

mommas gone
goodbye to daddy

well this is goodbye the end of you and me
weve set this boat ablaze pushed it out to sea
nothing thats on board will survive
this is goodbye

well this is goodbye not the kind weve had before
were out of one more tries wont be anymore
and all the grays have turned to black and white
this is goodbye

this is hard this is hell this is pain like i have never felt
oh this is final love has failed
this is walking away from us to save ourselves
this is goodbye

well this is goodbye in my heart theres no doubt
cause i can feel the broken pieces trying to cut their way out
some of them i know ill never find

that song came out back in 
way way before there was you and me
the guy who sang it wore a sharkskin suit
had elvis like hair and italian boots

somebody new brought it back again
it dont sound much like it did back then
the melody still makes that magic dust
when it touched you n me now we fell in love

that song is a timeless thing
make a man give a woman a diamond ring
two hearts singin along
can make it rain champagne
make that old moon glow
down on lovers lane
theres lipstick on the radio

its only music and its only words
but thats us baby in every verse
fifty years from now on our anniversary day
ill know just what to tell that band to play

that song is a timeless thing
make a man give a woman a diamond ring
two hearts singin along
can make it rain champagne
make that old moon glow
down on lovers lane
theres lipstick on the radio

if the moon could conceal
how it feels when it shines
and the stars could disguise
the beauty the skies reveal
then the fire i try to hide in my heart
would remain out of sight
here with you in the dark

lets steal the sun
before tomorrow comes
daybreak might take this all away
lets be thieves
and rob the east of mornings light
lets steal the sun
before it steals tonight

oh how ive missed
being kissed tenderly
lips so soft and sweet
touching my cheek like this
what else can i do
but choose to give in
the only way i can lose
is if this feeling ends

im standing at a traffic light somewhere in west la
waiting for the sign to change then ill be on my way
the noise the heat the crush of cars just robs me of my nerve
and someone yells and blasts their horn and pins me to the curb

im a stranger here no one you would know
my ship has not come in but i keep hoping though
and i keep looking past the sun that sets above
saying to myself goodnight america

and im driving into houston on a rain slicked texas road
land so flat and sky so dark i say a prayer to float
should all at once the sanasito surge beyond its banks
like noah reaching higher ground id offer up my thanks

cause im a stranger here no one you would know
im just passing through i am therefore i go
the moon rose in the east but now its right above
as i say aloud goodnight america

midnight its hard to see the stars
out on a highway near atlanta
full of strip malls and used cars

first light just roll your window down
and smell the salty air
perfume of charleston town

im looking with a pilgrims eyes upon some promised land
and dreaming with my heart outstretched as if it were my hand
and ill hit the cross bronx just in time to beat the rush hour lock
i have no clue what time it is from this worlds busted clock

im a stranger here no one you would know
im from somewhere else well isnt everybody though
i dont know where ill be when the sun comes up

i remember it just like yesterday
the friday night we held our senior prom
id walked outside to get some air
and found her there in billy taylors arms

the kids all laughed at me and said
they known about it since our junior year
i got so mad and hurt so bad
i hit the road and stayed for twenty years

it still hurts today the same way its hurt for twenty years
all the heartaches linger and they still point their finger at me
and all my painful souvenirs i thought maybe id matured a bit

maybe try again in twenty years

the dutchman is not the kind of man
to keep his thumb jammed in a dam that holds his dreams in
but thats a secret only margaret knows

when amsterdam is golden
in the morning margaret brings him breakfast she believes him
he thinks the tulips bloom beneath the snow
hes mad as he can be but margaret only sees that sometimes
sometimes she sees her unborn children in his eyes

chorus
let us go to the banks of the ocean
where the walls rise above the zuider zee
long ago i used to be a young man
now dear margaret remembers that for me

the dutchman still wears wooden shoes
his hat and coat are patched with the love that margaret sewed him
sometimes he thinks hes still in rotterdam
he watches tugboats down canals
and calls out to them when he thinks he knows the captain
til margaret comes to take him home again
through unforgiving streets that trip him though he holds her arm
sometimes he thinks that hes alone and calls her name

chorus

the windmills whirl the winter wind
she winds his muffler tighter
they sit in the kitchen
some tea with whiskey keeps away the dew
he sees her for a moment
he calls her name out
she makes the bed up humming some old love song
she learned the tune when it was very new
he hums a line or two
they hum together in the dark

picture they took of you in your cowboy hat
makes you look like you are one of the boys
out on a saturday night meanwhile on the outskirts of the dance hall
im a joke that youd probably enjoy
on the outside of memphis all the building look big
and the white picket fences all dare to charge around the lawn
and hold their heads up high when my headlights find them out
theyll be the first to put their hands in the air with my radio on
singing a country song soft and low

oh when ive got a worried mind i know
i hear the ghost of patsy cline
on the grand old opry show

living on the edge of the city limit line
this is where the boundary finally ends
and i swear that were the last living souls in a populated ghost town
all the billboards are our best friends
which way did our last chance go and can we
get out if we go right now
it seems that with the malls and the megachurch stadiums
we would get out if we knew just how with the radio on

standing in line to get my selfhelp book signed off
on by the reverend who shouts to the converted
have mercy on this boy he did it all by the book
but still kind of has his doubts
oh you look pretty good in that jonquil dress
but your smile is a wooden nickels pride
and i know that it aint worth much but i feels good to touch

and if you could see inside this achin heart of mine

with your back against the wall

well sail an endless sea under a starry sky
and when the cold wind blows well hold each other close

her suitcase still stood in the hall

and the hours passed by even as the trucks passed by out on the highway

shook the rain from their hats and as the poor girl
brought them their coffee she overheard the words that they said

he had plastic bags wrapped round his shoes
he was covered with the evening news
had a pair of old wool socks on his hands
the bank sign was flashing  below
it was freezing rain an spittin snow
he was curled up behind some garbage cans
i was afraid that he was dead
i gave him a gentle shake
when he opened up his eyes
i saidold man are you ok

he saidi just climbed out of a cottonwood tree
i was runin from some honey bees
drip dryin in the summer breeze
after jumpin into calico creek
i was walkin down an old dirt road
past a field of hay that had just been mowed
man i wish youd just left me alone
cause i was almost home

then he saidi was comin round the barn
bout the time he grabbed my arm
when i heard momma holler son hurry up
i was close enough for my own nose
to smell fresh cobbler on the stove
when i saw daddy loadin up the truck
cane poles on the tailgate
bobbers blowin in the wind
since july of

shes wheeled into the hallway
till the sun moves down the floor
little squares of daylight
like a hundred times before
shes taken to the garden
for the later afternoon
just before her dinner
they return her to her room

chorus
and inside her mind
she is running
she is running in the summer wind
inside her mind
she is running in the summer wind
like a child again

the family comes on sunday
and they hover for awhile
they fill her room with chatter
and they form a line of smiles
children of her children
bringing babies of their own
sometimes she remembers
then her mama calls her home

chorus

playmate come out and play with me
its raining its poring the old man is snoring
and bring your dollies three
bumped his head on the edge of the bed
climb up my apple tree
never got up in the morning
slide down my rain barrel

into my cellar door
come again another day
and well be jolly friends
little johnny wants to play
forevermore
some more

five brothers who left arkansas

five brothers and three in their teens

he was by the waterhole
five rifles rang out through the night

look up a man this lonesome road
hang down your head and cry
for we often lose some things in life
that makes us wonder why

oh the fairest love i ever had
now sleeps beneath the clay
i live in hopes and dreams of her
that well meet again someday

i often said and wonder why
life has to be this way
but after all is said and done
im sure god has his say

id like to be a small part of life
with some good things to achieve
just to know ive been a fruitless part
would give my poor heart grief

theres a stranger in the house nobodys seen his face
but everybody says hes taken my place
theres a stranger in the house no one will ever see
but everybody says he looks like me

and now you say youve got no expectations
but i know you also miss those carefree days
and for all the angry words that passed between us
you still dont understand me when i say

maybe i give up too easy
maybe i dont fight enough
maybe my heart is afraid of falling in love

maybe im too scared to find out
what it feels like to hurt
maybe i worry ill land with my face in the dirt

but if i dont try i wont know
these walls that surround me theyre strong and theyre tall
i could slip and fall with no one to catch me at all
and end up alone

an honest hearts trying to love me
but i had nothing to give
i just wanted to see how much i could get

were all guilty of wanting
the very thing we cant have
but the more that we take the sooner well crash

oh and if i dont try i wont know
these walls that surround me theyre strong and theyre tall
i could slip and fall with no one to catch me at all
and end up alone

but somethings changing inside me
something here it wants to break free
well i thought love was a blind spot i believe
i dont want to end up alone

so maybe i give up too easy
maybe i dont fight enough
maybe my heart is afraid of falling in love

your coming here just isnt right
you didnt stop to say hello

is she walking out on you
or did you choose to let her go
there must be something on your mind
you didnt stop to say hello

well come on in close the door
dont stand there trembling in the cold
youll have the neighbors talking more
id better turn the lights down low

and go ahead and shed a tear
dont be afraid to let it show
you know ill always landed near
you didnt stop to say hello

whats a matter cant you see
for you havent said one single word
you look so tired and so weak
things must be worse than what ive heard

oh i guess its useless to pretend
because you know i love you so
you know youre welcome back again
im glad you stopped to say hello

in the worlds mighty gallery of pictures hang the scenes thatre painted from life
there hang pictures of love and of passion and theres pictures of sorrow and strife
there hang pictures of youth and of beauty of old age and a blushing young bride
but the saddest of all that hang on the wall are the pictures from lifes other side
just a picture from lifes other side someone has fell by the way
a life has gone out with the tide that might have been happy some day
theres a poor old mother at home whos watching and waiting alone
just longing to hear from a loved one so dear its a picture from lifes other side
now the first scene is that of a gambler whos lost all his money at play
and he reaches down and takes his dead mothers ring from her finger
the one that she wore long ago on her wedding day
its his last earthly treasure but he stakes it
then bows his head that his shame he might hide
when they lifted his head they found he was dead
its just a picture from lifes other side
now the last scene is that by the river of a heartbroken mother and babe
as the harbor lights shine and they shiver on an outcast whom that no one can save
and yet she was once a true woman she was somebodys darling and pride
god help her she leaps for theres no one to weep its a picture from lifes other side

chorus
a tongue can accuse and carry bad news
the seeds of distrust it will sow
but unless youve made no mistakes in your life
be careful of stones that you throw

a neighbor was passing my garden one time
she stopped and i knew right away
that it was gossip not flowers she had on her mind
and this is what i heard my neighbor say

that girl down the street should be run from our midst
she drinks and she talks quite a lot
she knows not to speak to my child or to me
my neighbor then smiled and i thought

chorus

a car speeded by and the screamin of brakes
a sound that made my blood chill
for my neighbors one child had been pulled from the path
and saved by a girl lying still

the child was unhurt and my neighbor cried out
oh who was that brave girl so sweet
i covered the crushed broken body and said
the bad girl who lived down the street

 words by wb yeats music by brian miller 

i went out to the hazelwood
because a fire was in my head
i cut and peeled a hazel wand
and hooked a berry to a thread

and when white moths were on the wing
and mothlike stars were flickering out
i dropped a berry in a stream
and caught a little silver trout

when i had laid it on the floor
and went to blow the fire aflame
and something rustled on the floor
and something called me by my name
it had become a glimmering girl
with apple blossoms in her hair
who called me by my name and ran
and vanished in the brightening air

though i am old with wandering
through hollow lands and hilly lands
i will find out where she has gone
and kiss her lips and take her hand

and walk through long green dappled grass
and pluck till time and times are done
the silver apples of the moon
and the golden apples of the sun

and said by the way i own this bar

he still felt like he was empty as hell

he said son would you believe that

a little bit south of the okechobee theres a story that the swamp folks tell
about a mean old man named jesse langtree
and a sweet young maid and a bottomless well
that waters cold but that dont matter how deep it is no one can tell
just drop a stone youll never hear it splatter
it just falls down down forever in the bottomless well
through fifteen miles of snakes and gators
with the raging fever and the trembling chills
i wandered lost through the okechobee
and there i seen em sittin there by the bottomless well
yeah now there he sits
oh lets hear it for jesse now hey jesse

i asked her for a drink of water and as jesse slept me and her we talked a spell
she said that she was his wife and daughter lord lord
but his heart was cold cold and dark as the bottomless well
and as he slept i bent to kiss her i heard a loud and jealous yell
felt my head explode in darkness two big hairy arms picked me up
and dragged me to the bottomless well
i woke up in fear and trembling i was staring down into the jaws of hell
as he held me high above his shoulders
a gonna throw me down down down to the bottomless well
now here i sit in jesses big white wicker rocker
eatin his candy coated cashews sippin his orange lemonade
while that sweet young thing fans the flies from off my eyebrows
im dozin in the green catalpa shade
enjoying things that jesse langtree made oh god bless you jesse

im growing tired of the big city lights
tired of the glamor tired of the size
im alway dreaming of roaming once more
back to my home on the old river shore

days are dark and dreary everywhere i roam
how i long for mississippi and you
nothing seems to cheer me under heavens door
how i miss the mississippi and you

roaming the wide world over
always alone and blue so blue
i am sad and weary longing to go home
yes i miss the mississippi and you

mockingbirds are singing round the cabindoor
while i dream of mississippi and you
and my memories are bringing happy days of yore
i have spent in mississippi with you

roaming the wide world over
always alone and blue so blue
longing for my homeland on that muddy watershore

ive got to find a better coping mechanism
im falling apart disintegrating in the schism
is it a show or is it realism
lost and found and then i was locked up in a prison

i better find a more suitable solution
before i reach the most predictable conclusion
to be the victim of my personal delusion
just to find that ive been living an illusion

they say theres just no substitute for the real thing
the kind of chemical that can make your whole body sing
you can take the needle and shove it in your vein
and call it medication to alleviate you pain

i do my best to keep the confusion to a minimum
ill try not to be the monster of the millennium
someday theyll thank us for the hell that we was givin em
when all of this time we just hope we were borderline offendin em

they say theres just no substitute for the real thing
the kind of chemical that can make your whole body sing
scrub it till youre bleedin but you cant scrub out the stain
leave your mouth wide open while youre drowning in the rain

put your head down wipe the spit out your eye
aint nobody coming to your poor me parade
when trouble comes to your door what you ignoring it for
youll be standing there helpless when it comes on in

they say theres just no substitute for the real thing
the kind of chemical thatll make your whole body sing
you can test your merit you can show it some restraint
but in the end youre just a predictable refrain

oh aint nothing like the real thing
the kind of chemical thatll make your whole body sing
you can test your merit you can show it some restraint

g i dreamed that the great judgement c morning

and he g stood on the land and the d sea

as the g lost were told of their d fate

they g prayed but their d prayers were too g late

the rich man was there but his money

a pauper stood there in the judgement
his debts were too many to pay
the great man was there but his greatness
when death came was left far behind
the angel that opened the records
no trace of his greatness could find

god heard and remembered their cries
no sorrow in heaven forever
god wiped all the tears from their eyes
the gambler was there and the drunkard
and they who had sold them the drink
with people who gave them the license
together in hell they did sink

but self rightousness would not do

now you can say theres no such thing as santa
but after suing john deere i believe

hed been aguzzlin old jack daniels
and smokin that wacky weed
he mixed it with his medication
and run off with some bleachblonde named bernice

when we found him christmas mornin
we thought he had a heart attack
but he had tar prints on his forehead
and incriminatin hickies on his neck
on his what

chorus

but were all ashamed of grandpa
he took grandmas death too well
started watchin porno movies
and engaging in phone sex with cousin belle

its a better christmas without grandpa
last year in church he mooned the choir
at first we thought it was alzheimers
but looking back we realized he was wired

chorus

yeah i filed myself a lawsuit
and they awarded me two mil
you know grandpa didnt leave me nuthin
but thanks to that old john deere he got killed

funny all my friends and neighbras
turned up on the grand jury
laughs i bribed em like johnny cochran
did when they set oj simpson free
guilty

form a ring and wind and twine
round the ol grape vine
heavy on the wire from the house
salt the cow and kill the calf
meet yer lonesome with a once and a half
gents on the east and ladies on the south

the solemn boy carries his silver damage
sold but for the number and the image

his eyes have saddened making wine from the stems
empty ears longing for the wood and the skins
paper yellowed from the salt and the failure

when he sings he slurs
 uses the meat of his thigh
thold the book he wrote when he was lame
so wrapped up in his flat baritone
no castrato could woo him in from the rain

for he never raised his voice when his britches
was spillin over with that honey truck richness

his eyes have saddened making wine from the stems
empty ears longing for the wood and the skins
paper yellowed from the salt and the failure

well the stylus hit the patches
as he spit on the splashes
 sought out the scratches in the vinyl
neath a needle topped with nickels
to keep the tunes agoin
cracklin croonin  crowin

multicolored hardboiled  hidden
in the corners with the dogs rusty remnants

his eyes have saddened making wine from the stems
empty ears longing for the wood and the skins
paper yellowed from the salt and the failure

buddy some topeka night

when its just you and the road

seen no tailights there for miles

and nothin much but static on the radio

wasnt lookin to the left

wasnt lookin to the right

just kept walking like virginia to the surf

towards the far end of the night

time hangs like a noose

before me

time stills to a crawl

grinds so slowly

heard my own beloved cry

i heard my one beloved moan

whats the use in all the ache we must endure

i had no good reason why

time hangs like a noose

before me

time stills to a crawl

grinds so slowly

not a rail to grasp ahold

nor a savior there beside

juat kept a walkin like virginia to the surf

towards the far end of the night

time hangs like a noose

before me

time stills to a crawl

grinds so slowly

and time hangs like a noose

counting numbers in the air
cheekbone to a cool stone wall

or will you simply one day disappear

some boys with warm beds and cold cold hearts
they make you feel nothing at all
theyll never remember and theyll never mind
if youre counting the cracks in the wall
theyre quick and theyre greedy
they never feel guilty
they dont know the meaning of hurt
the boots just go back on the socks that stayed on
the next time they see you they treat you like dirt
the next time they treat you like dirt

chorus
now dont come the cowboy with me sonny jim
i know lots of those and youre not one of them
theres a light in your eyes tells me somebodys in and
you wont come the cowboy with me

dont be too rough on my cold cold heart
its all ive got left to me now
i fell out of favour with heaven somewhere
and im here for the hell of it now
some girls play cowboys and some boys play harder to get
but theyre got just the same
they smile and say cheese theyre so eager to please
but theyll never remember your name
the names and the places all change

chorus

did somebody tell you im lonely as hell
i didnt expect you to know me so well
if i learned a lesson its how to bounce back again
sometimes i bounce off the wall
and sometimes my head hits the floor

chorus twice

i have failed and i have fallen cried till i was bawling
been down so low my face was on the tiles
where the cold against my lips hollow like your kiss
was empty as a north dakota mile
i tried leaving without losing but the hardest part was choosing
which direction i would run when i was free
and the only thing ive learned is that i havent learned a thing

ive drank one too many glasses ive been bruised and ive been battered
by mistakes i never bothered to avoid
and friends who tried to offer advice i didnt follow
grew tired of watching all that i destroyed
so i faked my best foot forward while sneaking backwards toward
the center where the truth wouldnt sting
and the only thing ive learned is that i havent learned a thing

we live we yearn we flame we burn we cry
we crawl we run we reach to touch the sky
and though our wings are made of wax
we try to fly too close to the light
trying to get it right first chorus
just to get it right second chorus

you stood there like a stoic made me feel so claustrophobic
wishing youd give me a reason not to leave
and the walls closed in tighter i felt like an outsider
in the home that was my haven all those years
but i knew that i was certain like the dropping of a curtain
when i saw youd taken off that ring
you see the only thing ive learned is that i havent learned a thing

look off down the highway
at the glittering lights
like windshield glass
on the shoulder tonight
as the diesels come
grinding on up from the plains
all bunched up like pearls on a string
and i guess time dont mean nothin
not nothin at all
and out on the horizon
the broken stars fall
old broken stars they
fall down on the land
and get mixed together
with the lights of cheyenne

well ive been up all night
and im down on my back
workin the counter
to take up the slack
cause the money trees light
and the whiskey streams low
you aint worked a week
since july

you say the gravel pits hiring
after the first
but you dont have the
nature for that kind of work
you might get hired on
but you wont make a hand
and ill still be here lookin
at the lights of cheyenne

you stand in the sky
with your feet on the ground
never suspectin a thing
but if the sky were to
move you might never be found
never be heard from again

we go on good behavior when
our youngest comes home
she comes up from boulder
but she never stays long
and that oldest still fights
me like she was 
stopped in for a pack awhile ago

and shes got a cowboy problem
and this last ones a sight
all dressed up like gunsmoke
for saturday night
and they were off to the bars
for lack of a plan
racing the stars to the lights of cheyenne

and youve kept all that
meanness inside you so long
youd fight with a fence post
if it looked at your wrong
well the post wont hit back
and it wont call the law
i look at your right
or i dont look at all

now take a crumpled up
soft pack and give it a shake
out by the dumpster on a cigarette break
with one eye swelled up from
the back of your hand
and the other eye fixed
on the lights of cheyenne

you stand in the sky with
your feet on the ground
never suspectin a thing
but if the sky were to
move you might never be found
never be heard from again

now theres antelope grazing
in range of my gun
come opening weekend
you wont see a one
theyll vanish like ghosts
cause somehow they know
but now theyre up to the
fence in the early dawn

and its warming up nicely
for this time of year
the creeks are still frozen but
the roads are all clear
and i dont have it in me
to make one more stand

so ask me again yes lets meet again
you know ive built a kingdom on second chances yes i did
well ive been there now once or twice
now tell me girl did you think that was very nice
and i would say it was just one moment
but it was gone just as fast as it came
so i drowned myself in a tall glass of whatever

you can save your sweet breath because

love is a powerful word
a little word that oughta mean something
love better mean what it says
say what you mean or it doesnt mean nothing
love is a dangerous door to open
if you dont feel it when its spoken

sometimes i said it when i really didnt mean it
just to throw away a promise i knew wasnt true
it meant a little less to me everytime i did it
but i never said i love you from the heart
til i said it to you

you made me tell you the truth
and that truth was a total revelation
i see i have it in me
now i can speak without any hesitation
i love you comes so freely
for the first time i believe me

to all the girls i once caressed
and may i say ive held the best
for helping me to grow i owe a lot i know
to all the girls ive loved before

the winds of change are always blowing
and every time i tried to stay
the winds of change continued blowing
and they just carried me a way

to all the girls who shared my life
who now are someone elses wife
im glad they came along
i dedicate this song
to all the girls ive loved before

to all the girls who cared for me
who filled my nights with ecstasy
they live within my heart
ill always be a part
of all the girls ive loved before

the winds of change are always blowing
and every time i tried to stay
the winds of change continued blowing
and they just carried me way

to all the girls weve loved before
who traveled in and out our door
were glad they came along
we dedicate this song
to all the girls weve loved before

to all the girls weve loved before
who traveled in and out our doors
were glad they came along
we dedicate this song
to all the girls weve loved before

jim lauderdale

many times temptation grows so strong
and makes someone go blind to what is wrong
well stop right now while theres still the strength to see
turn your eyes and run away from me

stay out of my arms
take me advice its easy to break
the same heart twice
lets stop the hurt before it starts
dont follow me stay out of my arms

im sure youll find someone to have and hold
and keep the promises you were told
id only lead you on and let you down
and hurt you when good memories cant be found

on a park bench on sunny afternoon sat a young boy and a girl bout seventeen
as we stood so closely by watched them hold each others hand
on their faces love had written were making plans
then he said to her youre my guiding light
then she said to him you make my whole world seem so bright
then we saw their books of braille and that neither one could see
then i thought how close they must be
souch tenderness my eyes have never seen two young lovers both just in their teens
though their world gives them no light they see more than you and me
dont you know how close they must be
then a car stopped just a few steps away
and a voice said jim and jeannie its time to go
with their hands still clutched so tight helping each other to the car
can you imagine just how close they are

we started out with good intentions makin love right there in the kitchen

you laughed at my jokes and you danced to the song
not to bad for an amarillo country boy  country boy
i said if we could just stay together
it could be just like this forever
finer things in life we would enjoy

a laughing baby boy one evening in his play
disturbed the household with his noisy glee
i warned him to be quiet but he soon would disobey
for he would soon forget a word from me

i called him to my side and said now son you go to bed
your conduct has been very very rude
with quivering lips and tear filled eyes he pleaded then with me
dont make me go to bed papa and ill be good

dont papa and ill be good
dont papa and ill be good
thats what i heard him say and it haunts me night and day
dont make me go to bed papa and ill be good

our lives have just been gladdened by his bright ascending beam
our boy now in our hearts was very dear
we hastened to his bed one night he was talking in his sleep
he didnt seem to know that we were near

i took him in my arms and found his body raked with pain
to ease the pain we did the best we could
it broke my heart to hear him cryin loudly in his sleep
dont make me go to bed papa and ill be good

all night and day we watched and prayed we never left his side
to give him up it seemed we never could
it broke my heart to hear him crying just before he died

talking of tomorrow and the money love and time we have to spend
loving her was easier than anything ill ever do again

coming close together with a feeling that ive never known before in my time

and the whole world seems at war
you bring me peace of mind once more
with just a little love

when the boss says im ten minutes late
and the stack of bills just wont wait
oh you take the worries away
with just a little love

chorus
just a little love
and affection
you bring a touch of perfection
to a world thats sometimes crazy
and so mixed up
just a little love
you have changed me
you make me see why the good lord made me
and you can do miracles
with just a little love

when our old car wont run
and all my dreams come undone
youll make it right wont ya hun
with just a little love

when it seems like all the truths are gone
when im trying so hard to hold on
you make it easy to be strong
with just a little love

i dont want to hear a love song
i got on this airplane just to fly
i know theres life below me
and all that you can show me is the prairie and the sky
i dont want to hear a sad story filled with heartbreak and desire
the last time i felt like this
i was in the wilderness and the canyon was on fire
and i stood on the mountain in the night
and i watched it burn i watched it burn i watched it burn

i would rock my soul in the bosom of abraham
i would hold my life in a saving grace
i would walk all the way from boulder to birmingham
if i thought i could see see your face

well you really got me this time
and the hardest part is knowing i survive
and ive come to listen to the sounds of trucks
as they moved out on highway 
and pretending its the ocean coming to wash me clear
to wash me clear if you know what i mean

i would rock my soul in the bosom of abraham
i would hold my life in a saving grace
i would walk all the way from boulder to birmingham

late at night a disc jockey plays a sad song by request
for some lonely girl in a one room world whose tears wont let her rest
for she lives every word of the song she just heard
as she clutches her pillow so tight
shes just one of those lonely people in the night

its three am in new york city but the wino he doesnt know
his bottle is empty his pockets are empty and where did his pals all go
he shared with them and he cared for them
for a while everything was all right
now hes one of those lonely people in the night

just look at the lonely people in this world
theres too many women without a man and boys without a girl
if we lonely people could find one another
what a happy world this could be
for theres too many lonely people just like me

ive been running low on inspiration
tired of that physical intrigue
theres nothing left to imagination
living in a world that treats love so carelessly

dont want no smooth talkin lover
i cant play the role
it just leaves me cold

i need a high powered love
i wanna feel that lightning streak
high powered love
got to be down in the heart with me

sometimes its hard to keep believing
too many pretty faces all skin deep
is there anyone left with teeth just a little uneven
and wont spend more time with a mirror than me

if youre just looking for a good time
a notch on your gun
i aint the one

i want a high powered love
got to have intensity
high powered love
dont start the fire if you cant take the heat

i cant turn back im on a mission
i know theres someone out there for me

i need a high powered love
one thatll defy gravity
high powered love
got to be strong and keep on lifting me

higher higher higher

on that judgment day youll weep and youll cry

one evening for pleasure i rambled
on the banks of some cold purling stream
i set down on a bed of primroses
and i gently fell into a dream
i dreamt that i saw a fair female
her equal i never saw before
and i sighed for the laws of our country
as we stray there on ireland s green shore

her cheeks were like two bloomin roses
her teeth were like ivory so white
her eyes shone like two sparkling diamonds
or the stars on some cold frosty night
she was dressed in the richist attire
and green was the mantle she wore
all bound down with the hemlocks and the roses
as we stray there on ireland s green shore

transgression of joy i awoken
i found this was only a dream
that pretty fair female had fled me
i longed to be slumbering again
may the heavens above be her guardian
though i know i ll never see her anymore
may the goldliest sunbeam shine upon her
as she lies sleeping on ireland s green shore

on the banks of some cold purling stream

you wouldnt silently consent when the liars speak
denying all the dying of the remedy

if you never rode west of the arizona border
you can turn the other way boy but you never get far
you be living a lie if you wanna see the wonders of the age
you must follow the evening star

evening star
shine a little heaven
on a stranger with no dream
where you are

you can see the loneliness i mean and if i gotta fight
i can never play somebody elses game i can follow the evening star
starlight you never need somebody elses name
if you follow the evening star

have you ever known a sunset when the skys on fire
how you end another day boy youve been searching too far
like the desert i rode on any memory is lost in the restless wind
i just lie beneath the evening star

evening star
shine a little heaven
on a stranger with no dream
where you are

have you ever held a woman in the california moonlight
put your money on a good night if you never been there
its a sight for sore eyes if you wanna see the wonders of the age
making love beneath the evening star

evening star
shine a little heaven
on a stranger with no dream
where you are

you can see the loneliness i mean and if i gotta fight

i heard you call my name saw you standing at the door
i reached out to hold you but you faded away

turning through the pages of my memory
and everywhere i look theres me and you

whatever happened to us
somehow through the years we lost touch
lately ive been missing you so much
whatever happened to us

i always thought we look so good together
how did we come to drift so far apart
these pictures cry for answers to one question
why did we break each others hearts

whatever happened to us
somehow through the years we lost touch
lately ive been missing you so much
whatever happened to us

her real first name was betty but id rather just forget it
so ill call her the first mrs jones
we were married in september and it lasted till november
then one day she just took out on her own
i followed her to savannah new orleans and then atlanta
every day i begged her to come home
pretty soon i started drinking tryin hard to keep from thinking
just how much i loved the first mrs jones
it was cold and dark one morning just before the day was dawning
when i staggered from a tavern to a phone
when she picked up her receiver i said youre gonna come back or either
theyre gonna be calling you the late mrs jones
i put a pistol in my jacket stumbled out and hailed a taxi
i told taxi driver to take me to her home
i remember walkin proudly everybody said i yelled out loudly
come on out or im gonna come in mrs jones
then next thing i recall was walking to the forest
lookin for a place to hide her bones
i dug and dug for hours and then i planted flowers
right on the top of the first mrs jones
did my little story scare you oh i can see cause im so near you
little beads of perspiration dot your clothes
arent you sorry now that you left me
really now doesnt you want to come go with me
after all you are the second mrs jones

seventeen and innocent
i wonder where all the years went
lookin back on a youth misspent
god i miss those days

all the chances that we took
always leaped and never looked
i tell you i could write a book
on all the hell we raised

chorus
thought i was cool with my lucky stripes
i didnt start too many fights
but in those days i finished quite a few
beatup cars and the cheapest wine
and any trouble we could find
the worst of days were the best of times
lookin back through lifes rearview
lookin back
i miss my misspent youth

im no worse now for the wear
ive gotten married and cut my hair
me and her were quite a pair
all my friends say

and speaking of old friends
we still talk now and then
cept now theres a few of them
you can only reach by prayer

chorus
we were cool with our lucky stripes
didnt start too many fights
but in those days we finished quite a few
beatup cars and the cheapest wine

early in the morning sometimes late at night

early in the evening sometimes in the day

how can you refuse him now how can you refuse him now
how can you turn away from his side
with tears in his eyes on the cross there he died
how can you refuse jesus now

theres a story old that has often been told of how our saviour died
as they nailed his hands he cried they dont understand
as the blood flowed from his side
how can you refuse him now
 steel 
as he hung there on the tree he prayed for you and me
there was no one his pain to ease
before he died he faintly cried oh father forgive them please
how can you refuse him now

crossing all of those lines and crawling back

slipping from your skin you couldnt keep it in

at another sound you missed your turn slowing down
caught in the lights and left again
without the time to forget coming up for air
from the hollow prayer you were sleeping through
as you went nowhere the cold would come as theyd always done
and run into almost anyone

curled in the rocks beyond their days
leaving the rest to find their way
the tempered tried as they rushed to hide
already gone with no goodbyes lockedup and out of key

luring you out until you could remember the chance you took

youd have a room full of roses

and if you took the petals
and you took them all apart
youd be tearing at the roses
just the way you tore my heart

if someday youre feeling blue
and you could send some roses too
well i dont want a room full of roses
i just want my arms full of you

and if you took the petals
and you took them all apart
youd be tearing at the roses
just the way you tore my heart

well bring me something new that i havent felt before
like messages of love and directions to your door
but please talk slowly i dont hear good anymore

and we all fall down
and we all fall down

dont die on me lady only good things can come
to those who practice reason and recognize good fun
your absence is the bullet and the past is your gun

then we all fall down
and we all fall down

well she still doesnt answer though she knows shes done wrong
weve buried the memories along with the songs
when she wakes up well i hope that we are gone

and we all fall down
and we all fall down

theres a visitor in black at my neighbors house
my neighbor says tomorrow the visitor says now
when he comes here please tell him that im out

and we all fall down

all i can be
is a sweet memory
that drifts through your mind
from time to time
i can never be more
than a knock on your door
just a shadow thats gone
with the sunshine
for you know im not free
and i never can be
and youre bound
to get restless in time
all i can be
is a sweet memory
that drifts through your mind

tonight i shed
a silent tear
while lyin here with you
the sands of time
have trickled down
to just a precious few
youre young and so beautiful
and im so glad im here
but the ending is painfully clear

all i can be
is a sweet memory
of someone you had
to leave behind
who loves you and needs you
but never could give you
the ring for your finger so fine
so tonight well just borrow
each other tomorrow
well find that weve run out of time
and all i can be

well i was raised in a sophisticated kind of style
but my taste in music and women drove my folks half wild
mom and dad had a plan for me it was debutantes and symphonies
but i like my music hot and my women wild
you see i like my women just a tad on the trashy side

when they wear their clothes too tight and their hair is dyed
too much lipstick and too much rouge
gets me excited leaves me feeling confused
i like my women just a tad on the trashy side

well you should have seen the look on the face of my dad and mom
when i showed up at the door with my date for the senior prom
they said pardon us son she aint no kid
thats a cocktail waitress in a dolly parton wig
i said i know aint she great dad
thats the kind i dig
see i like my women just a tad on the trashy side

when they wear their clothes too tight and their hair is dyed
too much lipstick and too much rouge
gets me excited leaves me feeling confused
i like my women just a tad on the trashy side

yea i like em sweet
i like em with a heart of gold
but i like em brassy
i like em brazen and bold
they say opposites attract well i dont agree
i need a woman thats as tacky as me

too much lipstick and too much rouge
gets me excited leaves me feeling confused

to see the sights of home
growing ever anxious

my mind begins to travel
to a time so long ago

like candy canes and hand made things
socks hanging on the mantle
turkey baking decorations handdipped candy apple
all the plays and happy times are faces all aglow
as i pray to god for blessings on our christmas time at home

soon ill be with family
precious time well spend together
laughing sharing memories of the moments we still treasure
spirit of the season and the joy and love it brings
as i travel home for christmas and enjoy the simple things

if i had a million i would build you a mansion
a hundred miles from nowhere with all a girl could need
we would run through the hallways and dance in the backyard

settle in some little border town
wed drink margaritas and dance to mariachis
put you on my speed plane and i would bring you back home

dock in some little port of call
