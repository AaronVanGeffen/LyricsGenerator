he left a card a bar of soap and a scrubbing brush next to a note
that said use these down to your bones
and before i knew i had shiny skin and it felt easy being clean like him
i thought this one knows better than i do

a triangle trying to squeeze through a circle
he tried to cut me so id fit

and doesnt that sound familiar doesnt that hit too close to home
doesnt that make you shiver the way things couldve gone
and doesnt it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more
and so that i do remember to never go that far
could you leave me with a scar

so the next one came with a bag of treats she smelled like sugar and
spoke like the sea
and she told me dont trust them trust me
then she pulled at my stitches one by one looked at my insides clicking
her tongue and said
this will all have to come undone

a triangle trying to squeeze through a circle
she tried to cut me so id fit

could you leave me with a scar

and i realized just in time although my old self was hard to find
you can bathe me in your finest wine but ill never give you mine
cause im a little bit tired of fearing that ill be the bad fruit nobody buys
tell me did you think wed all dream the same

in june of  there was a military coup
behind it was a gang called the gou
who did not feel the need to be elected
they had themselves a party at the point of a gun
they were slightly to the right of attila the hun
a bomb or two and very few objected
just one shell and governments fall like flies
kapow die
they stumble and fall
bye bye
backs to the wall
aim high
were having a ball
the tank and bullet ruled as democracy dies
the ladys got potential
she was setting her sights
of making it in movies
with her name in lights
the greatest social climber
since cinderella
okay she couldnt act
but she had the right friends
and we all know a career depends
on knowing the right fella to be stellar
just one shell and governments lose their nerve
kapow die
they stumble and fall
bye bye
backs to the wall
aim high
were having a ball
thats how we get the government we deserve
now the man behind the president
calling the shots
involved so discreetly in a lot of their plots was colonel juan peron wouldbe dictator
he began in the army out in italy so
saw mussolinis rise from the very front row
i reckon hed do likewise sooner or later
just one blast and the tear gas falls like rain
kapow die
they havent a chance
bye bye
the terrorists advance
but one guy
doesnt dirty his hands
peron was biding time out in the slow lane
suddenly a earthquake hit the town of san juan
kapow die
they stumble and fall
bye bye
keep away from the wall
but one guy
was having a ball
the tragedy a golden chance for peron
he organized a concert with incredible flair
he named off all the victims such a grand affair politicians actors stars of every flavor
it was january   a night to remember yeah thats for sure
for thats the night that peron first met eva
for thats the night that peron first met eva

verse 
sunday mornin  its a quarter to five
you keep on talkin like your love is a prize
bird in flight  spreadin her wings
sittin pretty in a city of sin

release 
i dont mind  adventure with a stranger
trouble deep at the scene of the crime
testify  that im not superstitious
its tough enough  to find out why you

chorus
radiate  you bait your love with money
celebrate  a body to behold
generate  a state of wild emotion
dont waste your money  my love is not for sale

verse 
funny faces in the shadows of night
pain and pleasure is your only disguise
radiate  your fates on the fire
stay awake  love is a lie

release 
in the street  life is your creation
trouble deep if you wake up on your own
im a slave to sweet investigation
its tough enough to find out why you

once there was light
perfectly white
far as the eye could wander
once there was time
morning and night
once there was sky over yonder

the day begins
metropolis lies sleeping like a drunken soldier
behind the wheel you come alive
and down into its heart you motor
atop the rise  metropolis
defender of the high and mighty
at every turn the homeless wait
reminding you of all that might be

hurry now there is somebody there to meet you
office girls sweet and innocent poised to greet you
through the glass fifty stories below you
theres a place ive been meaning to show you
full of sights that are certain to blow you away

beneath the haze
metropolis awakens with a hiss and rumble
youll hear a knock dont hesitate
they mustnt ever see you stumble
youll never last down on the street
where staying on your toes aint ballet
its getting by or getting beat
from curtain to the grand finale

in the air there is music and sounds of laughter
for the moment its happily ever after
through the glass fifty stories below you
in the shadows where nobody knows you
theres a stranger whos dying to show you the way

now entering metropolis
creation of a world gone crazy
the alleyway  the resting place
still echo from the souls trapped under
you lock the doors step on the gas
and push until it goes no faster
you close your eyes and leave behind
metropolis lord and master

verse 

as a child i was so young  free
i felt so confident as you carried me
you held me so close  always believed
you instilled in me a sense of purpose  destiny

the world is black  white as seen thru the eyes of a child
innocence so pure it lasted for a while
i miss the day the calm you let me feel
you always believed in me  made everything so real

chorus 

i miss being a child
i miss feeling a bit wild
no care in the world for me
a childs mind open for all to see

a childs mind is so young  free
a child will always believe
a childs mind once belonged
to you and me

verse 

the years have passed on
many days have come and gone
my intentions once good
my actions now sometimes wrong

once wide eyed  full of spunk
now so negative  always drunk
lost looking in the rain
for that childlike innocence again

i was all through with romance
figured love was kaput
no more pretending no happy ending
then like a bolt from the blue
you walked into my life
clever and charming slightly alarming
just when i thought that my love life was all past tense
suddenly you start making sense

i was prepared to simply call it a day
ready for love to turn the lights out

in the nick of time
looks like you started something now i wasnt ready for this
was content all alone

hey this is now that was then
im in business again
using your razor driving your blazer
just when i thought my libido was fireproof
you fan my flames right through the roof

you are the kittyhawk of romance
you are columbus setting out
cause without a doubt
looks like you started somethin now

i sense a brand new beginning
something akin to break of day
you are the start of a new career
youre the crowing of chanticleer
saying wake up and smell the coffee

i dont know where were going or for how long
so ill rely on fundamentals
cause if a kiss is still a kiss
lets not finish this
looks like you started somethin
you really started something
looks like you started somethin now

its raining again
im hearing its pitter patter down
its wet in the street
reflecting the lights and splashing feet

nowhere to go
and nothing i have to do have to do

its raining again
i follow the christmas lights down town
im leaving the flow
of people walking all around round and round

i hear the sound of rain falling in my ears
washing away the weariness like tears
i can feel my troubles running down
disappear into the silent sound

just walking along
my clothes are soaked right through to the skin
i havent a doubt that this is what life is all about
the sun and the rain

scraps of brain washing down the drain
i feel the rain falling on my face
i can say there is no better place
than standing up in the falling down
in so much rain i could almost drown

its raining again
a crack in the clouds reveals blue skies
ive been feeling so low
low
but now everything is on my side the sun and the rain

walk with me fill my heart again
i hear the rain falling in my ears
washing away the weariness like tears
i can feel my troubles running down
disappear into the silent sound

i feel the rain falling on my face
i can say there is no better place
than standing up in the falling down
in so much rain i could almost drown

something tells me your the kinda guy id like to get to know

could you be visiting or are you new in town
whatever the case im feeling you right here and right now
your smile and all the love you show me lets me know that you

have no fear
when darkness falls

within us all

although this world

when we reach inside
we find our warmth

cause theres a flame that burns
in every heart
and its the will we have
that lights the spark

once in every lifetime
theres a chance to stand apart

our very best
reveal whats in our heart

we wont stay down
we will get back up
and use the strength weve found

and we will rise
like champions
every obstacle
well overcome

oozing like napalm from the speakers and grill
of your radio
into the mouths of babes
and across the backs of its willing slaves

funk pop a roll consumes you whole
gulping in your opium so copiously from a disco
everything you eat is waste

big money selling you stuff that you do not need

funk pop a roll for fish in shoals
music by the yard for the children they keep
like poseable dolls

you pegs in your holes

intro
this song is about maria
a close friend of mine
who lost herself in drugs
she told me to wait for her
but guess what
she never came back
and im still waiting
she told me

chorus
wait til you hear from me
monday tuesday it wont be
wednesday thursday we will see
if only you can wait baby

wait til you here from me
friday use your fantasy
saturday you got over me
if only you can wait baby

verse 
she was called maria and she really was a friend
i remember when we were walking hand in hand
she was telling me that she understands
all the world and every thrill by taking little pills
so she was trying everything and more
alcohol and speed coke and weed and tried to score
tragedy she didnt feel much better than before
so she got away here quick to find a better kick

bridge
never let it  wanna find her
cant forget it  to remind her
shes my sister  wanna tell her
how i miss her  she told me

chorus

bchorus
wait  dont call youve got to
wait til you hear from me
wait  thats all youve got to
wait

verse 
when she arrived in the city of the stars
blinded by the lights a burning in the heart
she believed to play what she called her part
a member of society to satisfy her dreams
no one paid attention on her skills
so she found crack is another way to fill
the emptiness inside right now she got her thrill
guess who gave his life away she did it every day

bridge

chorus

narrationpart
why did she throw her life away
why did she say dont call just wait

cpart
if you wanna go to the city of stars
can you help me to find my girl maria
she once was an actress and a beauty queen
then the drugs took over and made her mean
i tried to stand by her side make her feel alright
but she wished to get over to the other side
and since i cant really get her out of my mind
im asking you wont you help me to find
she told me

chorus

bchorus
<e>
<s>
you are not alone
i am here with you
even when youre scared
ill never leave you
standing in a storm

making it insane
once again i will try
to enchain you
but you open your eyes to the sky
and whisper

chorus 
that you are so lonely
you are so alone
youre so alone
youre so lonely so lonely

so im coloring my face
while i am here with you
imagining the landscape of your sorrow
is it yellow or blue

coloring the sky and the trees
and the clouds and the moonlight
id colored your heart
if you didnt i did

chorus 
youre so alone
youre so lonely so lonely

and i wish you could just find home
mmmmmm
<e>
<s>
walking by myself thinking how it all went down
and you thought i went crazy
but it just didnt make any sense to keep going

chorus
do it myself dont need you to show me how

this time i wont need help from you
thats what im gonna do
wont go back gonna show you what im made of
cant hold me down cause i will rise above
do this on my own i can do it alone
i can do it alone

it wont be easy
i know i have to find the way on my own
but how do i get there
just believe in myself so i need to keep going
now i know
you can run from mistakes turn around make it right

the smiles that you gave me the things you said
but its changing the way i dont understand

chorus

<s>
you give your hand to me and then you say hello
and i can hardly speak my heart is beating so
and anyone can tell you think you know me well
but you dont know me

no you dont know the one who dreams of you at night
and longs to kiss your lips longs to hold you tight
oh i am just a friend thats all ive ever been
cause you dont know me

i never knew the art of making love
no my heart aches with love for you
afraid and shy i let my chance go by
the chance that you might love me too

you give your hand to me and then you say goodbye
i watch you walk away beside the lucky guy
oh you will never know the one who loves you so
well you dont know me
<e>
<s>
you and i in a little toy shop
buy a bag of balloons with the money weve got
set them free at the break of dawn
til one by one they were gone
back at base bugs in the software
flash the message somethings out there
floating in the summer sky
ninetynine red balloons go by

ninetynine red balloons
floating in the summer sky
panic bells its red alert
theres something here from somewhere else
the war machine springs to life
opens up one eager eye
focusing it on the sky
where ninetynine red balloons go by

ninetynine decision street
ninetynine ministers meet
to worry worry super scurry
call the troops out in a hurry
this is what weve waited for
this is it boys this is war
the president is on the line
as ninetynine red balloons go by

ninetynine knights of the air
ride super hightech jet fighters
everyones a super hero
everyones a captain kirk
with orders to identify
to clarify and classify
scramble in the summer sky
ninetynine red balloons go by

as ninetynine red balloons go by

ninetynine dreams i have had
in every one a red balloon
its all over and im standing pretty
in this dust that was a city
if i could find a souvenir
just to prove the world was here
and here is a red balloon
i think of you and let it go
<e>

standing on the edge of forever
at the start of whatever
shouting love at the world
back then we were like cavemen
but we map the moon and the stars
then we forgave them

we will meet you where the lights are
the defenders of the faith we are
where the thunder turns around
theyll run so hard well tear the ground away

you know no one dies
in these love drowned eyes
through our love drowned eyes
well watch you sleep tonight

although no one understood
we were holding back the flood
learning how to dance the rain
we were holding back the flood
they said wed never dance again

bleeding but none of us leaving
watch your mouth son or youll find yourself floating home
here we come now on a dark star
seeing demons not what we are

tiny minds and eager hands
will try to strike but now will end today

theres progress now where there once was none
where there once was none then everything came along

although no one understood
we were holding back the flood learning how to dance the rain
there was more of them than us now theyll never dance again

you came crashing through the walls
when the conversation stalled
we all thought that you were dead
but you were hanging by a thread
before you took the final door
you drew the curtains took the floor
and then you opened up your heart
and all the ashes turned to stars

ultravioletinfrared
ultravioletinfrared
feel the static fill your head
ultravioletinfrared

when all the subway lights go down
when you drink and when you drown
even the drivers looking scared
because the visions getting blurred
when your passions walking blind
and youre too cruel or too kind
youre on a roller coaster ride
but its a magical design

ultravioletinfrared
ultravioletinfrared
feel the static fill your head
ultravioletinfrared

when youre burned out in the blaze
and the tapes are all erased
when the crossfires got you dazed
then youre crashed out and youre crazed
ah youre looking well though
ah you look like hell though
theres noone left to sell to
and its too late to tell you

and taught it how to sing

dropped you off at the train station

stop pushing me
im gonna do it my way

it seemed to me like it wont end
but it was never meant to
be more than just another trend
a phase that i would go through
you still dont see that
im not your little baby no more no

so please dont force me down that road
ill choose where ill be going
you cant dictate another day
dont make me spend one on when
i wanna fight for myself
and be debted to nobody else
no one but myself

stop pushing me
i gotta do it my way
stop pushing me
why dont you hear what i say

stop pushing me
cos we dont look for mistakes
stop pushing me
im gonna do it my way

my way is the only way i trust
my way whatever it costs
now dont get me wrong
the respect hasnt gone
but when can i have my say
and do it my way

stop pushing me
i gotta do it my way
stop pushing me
why dont you hear what i say

stop pushing me
cos we dont look for mistakes
stop pushing me
im gonna do it my way

catching up
your need to run has left me out of breath
your faith in me is in my head
dusty habbits on the shelf breaking silently unrepaired
making more than what i want to put you through

empty hands are hanging from the ceiling
my will to learn is not enough to fix this

all you need is someone to believe in

honestly your eyes reveal a strong curiosity
a rocky path is hard to beat
we like digging in the plants giving everything we ever got
letting down the ones we knew right from the start

all the people in all the world
will look for something that will keep it turning
everyones got to keep the will
every boy every girl

im no different why the other day
i saw death like an ocean that could wash us away
the only comfort that i got was this
i once was unlovely and now im kissed

i am born
aliver than the raging sea
stranger than the strangest beasts
than ever can be

after midnight and the night is black
you lie awake and the fear comes back
that your breath will stop
and this world will carry on

but i am born
once there was nothing here
not even the smell of fear
nothing at all

until you are born
gasping out and in to open air
taking hold of the atmosphere
and loving being born

a cigarette that bears a lipsticks traces
an airline ticket to romantic places
and still my heart has wings
these foolish things remind me of you

a tinkling piano in the next apartment
those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
a fairgrounds painted swings
these foolish things remind me of you

you came you saw you conquered me
when you did that to me
i knew somehow this had to be

the winds of march that make my heart a dancer
a telephone that rings but whos to answer
oh how the ghost of you clings
these foolish things remind me of you

the scent of smoldering leaves the wail of steamers
two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
oh how the ghost of you clings
these foolish things
remind me of you

how strange how sweet to find you still
these things are dear to me
they seem to bring you so near to me

the sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
oh how the ghost of you clings
these foolish things
remind me of you

than to burn in the spotlight open fire turn in the spitfire open fire

from the only home that youve never know
so cry cry as the years go by
is there something you left there
a mother holds her child for the first time
and the last time
in ambler

do you wish you could find a severance from
all the tears that drench your soul
is it all in your mind or is there something else
that youve never told
so try try push the pain aside
can you turn it around
when your hearts still in that town
this is goodbye for the last time
to ambler

will the morning see what you were meant to be
will you finally find some peace of mind
you always push and shove
for a mothers love
but your double mind says that
youre just fine
and now theres nowhere to go
and theres no one you know
and youre left all alone with the pain inside
until you look to the sky
until you lay down your pride
the place where your hurt was born
is where your heart will die

do you know where you are
youre in ambler

i brush my teeth and look in the mirror
and laugh out loud
as im beaming from ear to ear
id rather pick flowers instead of fights
and rather than flaunt my style id flash you a smile
of clean pearly whites

ive been to the dentist a thousand times so i know the drill
i smooth my hair
sit back in the chair
but somehow i still get the chills

have a seat he says pleasantly
as he shakes my hand and practically laughs at me
open up nice and wide he says peering in
and with a smirk he says dont have a fit
this will just pinch a bit
as he tries not to grin

when hygienists
leave on long vacations
thats when dentists scream and
lose their patience

talking only brings the toothaches on because
i say the stupidest things
so if my results go south i swallow my pride with an aspirin and shut my mouth

golf and alcohol dont mix
and thats why i dont drink and drive
because good grief
id knock out my teeth
and have to kiss my smile goodbye

if our lives were a movie
id know what to do
id write every scene with my heart
an rko picture that stars me and you
and this time id learn my part

id paint you some scenery
wed sing and wed dance
from morning til late afternoon
and when that scene is done
then id take down the sun
and for you darling ill hang the moon

wed wake up to sunshine
like lights on a set
youd reach out and thered be my hand
all day thered be music a perfect duet
that flows from the white baby grand

at night when youre frightened
id play you to sleep
that melody from clair de lune
and to fill up the sky
past the clouds i would fly
and for you darling ill hang the moon

hang the moon forever
so youd never fear the darkness
the darkness ive known
moon protect norma jean
so that shell never be alone
never alone

if our lives were a movie
then youd be the star
cause now i know the role i should play
to applaud all you do
all the things that you are
and just be there on opening day

i know in the past
that the lines were all wrong
and the music was never in tune
but the wish that i make
is for just one more take
because then darling
ill hang the moon

ill hang the moon above you
so youll never fear the darkness
the darkness of night
then youll know i love you
each time that you feel the light
feel the light

if our lives were a movie
then id cut away
all the moments when i wasnt there
the scenes that are happy
are all that will stay
the rest will dissolve into air

as the final reel ends
we might both shed a tear
for the ending is coming up soon
but when the screen fades to black
we can smile and look back
and for you darling ill hang the moon

they put him in the choir but the hymns he did not like
so he organized the angels and he led them out on strike

one day when god was walking around heaven to medidate
who should he see but harry chalkin slogans on the gate

i sat outside one afternoon in an old lawn chair
and i watched the sun set off for business west somewhere
and the sky turned water color pink and gold and blue
and the stars all showed up one by one and we waited for the moon

chorus
and i thought about you and i wondered why
it took so long to say goodbye
oh you shined so bright you blinded me
and left me so i couldnt see
that i was the moon chasing the sun
there was never a prayer of ever catching up
no matter how fast i would run
like the moon chasing the sun
just like the moon chasing the sun

the crickets called and the moon peeked out of the eastern sky
they both start up about this time each night
and the evening breeze dropped by and brought some sweet relief
and in the silver light i finally let go of the heat

you can search the world for that one thing
but its all the same

lay your body down
come and let me bring your
body down
listen to my voice
the only sound
as i lullaby you
lullaby you down

as the moon rides away from the sun
she takes all his light and reflects it
i relate them to us just for fun
theres a parallel thats unexpected
every star in the sky
reminds me of you
twinkling in my eyes
the way that you do
and i dont know why
i get so blue

everyday is filled with changes
no matter where you go
living in a world of strangers
so we go for what we know

lay your body down

body down

the only sound
as i lullaby you
lullaby you down

everyone believes in something

so bid the forest floor goodbye as you race the wind
and take to the sky you take to the sky

where the lost are finally found
touch your feathers to the breeze
and leave the ground

or what may yet be proved
the simple facts of life are such

you must remember this
a kiss is still a kiss
a sigh is just a sigh

and when two lovers woo
they still say i love you
on that you can rely
no matter what the future brings

jealousy and hate

and i barely even kissed you back

and kept you in my eyes till you were out of sight

didnt seem so important then

and kept you in my eyes till you were out of sight

i dont want to hear it but 
the truth 
where have you been

i know its easy to lose faith
we look simply for a change of pace
and i know my moods they go up and down
but when youre climbing walls dont i stick around
you caught me
on some little white lies
its you who taught me
about silent goodbyes
i have to ask you
where have you been

let me paint this picture for you baby

you spend your nights alone and he never comes home
and every time you call him all you get is a busy tone

i heard you found out
that hes doing to you what you did to me
aint that the way it goes

you cheated girl
my heart bleeded girl
so it goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt
just a classic case scenario
tale as old as time girl you got what you deserved

and now you want somebody to cure the lonely nights
you wish you had somebody that could come and make it right

but girl i aint somebody with a lot of sympathy
youll see see

what goes around comes back around
i thought i told ya hey
what goes around comes back around
i thought i told ya hey

what goes around comes back around
i thought i told ya hey
what goes around comes back around
i thought i told ya hey

see you should have listened to me baby

counting my blessings like stars in the sky
the sleep walking moon watching on

fourth of july has come its custom that we go
make our way up  a place we call our home

stanislaus rivers seen a heavy year of snow
ill pick and choose my battles where i cast my fishing pole

every year we make our way to the end of the road
the world seems to stop spinning

my father smiles
he says son when i die

take me up to iceberg meadows
under the sun lay my remains
i will seep into disaster creek
for years my ash will chase that setting sun
but my soul is here to stay

well boulder creek is runnin wild the banks have overflowed
no swimmin in our hole this year spend my day skippin stones

the pickups gone to dardanelle grab propane for the stove
the campfire burns tradition four generations old

i carved on that bridge one day my name and right below
my fathers name from yesteryear etched as a child

he says son when i die

take me up to iceberg meadows
under the sun lay my remains

thats when we must start
believing in the one thing that has gotten us this far

melt our defenses
bring us back to our senses

for protecting our children

told us we should love thy neighbour

told me i should vote new labour

if liars can be honest and right can be wrong

you have to stand up before you fall down
you need to get lost before you get found

young girl with a broken heart walking home alone
teardrops made of maybelline on a goodbye note
and looking down at the shadows on the ground she almost didnt see
a blue eyed man with a flower in his hand
walking right out of her dreams

and then reality crept in and erased it

for a while i thought that i could hold you
but you were just a temporary high

firefly you drew me to you
your beauty shines and lights up the sky
and you dont know it do you
i wish i could keep you firefly
firefly

something so beautiful and free
was as never meant to be caged in
i thought i had you in my hand
i tried to catch you but i cant
chase the wind

and just as i reach out to touch you
i remind myself you were meant to fly

firefly you drew me to you
your beauty shines and lights up the sky
and you dont know it do you
i wish i could keep you firefly
firefly

i like to think id be all that you wanted
not even that is enough

firefly you drew me to you
your beauty shines and lights up the sky
and you dont know it do you
i wish i could keep you
i wish i could keep you firefly
firefly

verse 
visions explode hearts that wont sleep
and dreams that seem untold
the future it brings
if god made us lights
then we must shine bright
everyone standing tall
hand in hand sowing seeds of
love of faith and hope
and we know that love will conquer all so

lets spread love
in the air
everywhere we go x

verse 
if you think about the things that make everyone cry
youll see that its lack of love
and think about the people that cause pain everyday
i wish they knew this love
because this love will make us stand so strong
because this love will never make us fall

verse 
now think about the mass destruction everywhere
the killings and earthquake
all over the streets there is chaos everyday
the scream of wickedness
but with love our soul would rise above darkness
with true love no wrong will make us cry

chorus
lets spread love
in the air
everywhere we go x

verse 
the pains feel so much to bear
and even though we fight we cannot make it right
all im saying is if we truly want to love
there is just one source and that is jesus
just think about it breathing love
teaching love living love
love of faith and hope
when we all can pray to the almighty
that all we need is the prince of peace
love of faith and hope
and he has got the whole world
whole wide world in his hands
and he has got the whole world
whole wide world

verse reggae
spread love in the air
everywhere we go
me a light it up up up in the air
everywhere me a go
and i can see another day
coming to my way
where evil and darkness will exist no more
for we could make now the time
to leave behind the past
so that the future love brings
will make us to smile
hit me one time
or make it two times
if me a sleeping make i wake up to the situation rising
me father is the creator
and i am a victor
born transformed to dominate the land
so tell me what a man cant do
if the king of all kings inna behind your dreamsbeloved
our nation is love come true
so get up on your feet and walk in the lightbeloved

rap 
i went undercover and i discover
that without love no one is better
no one is stronger or can cast asunder
no dream is clearer and no truth is greater
and these lives we live we all need the father
because with love there is light and it shines brighter
so when we stand tall we will never fall
one with god lives lives forever more

rap 
i just cant sit there and watch people say what they want to say do what they want to do and hurt people anyway because the basis of the reason were created is to be loves family and i dont see it happening whats the difference youre black or white or colored but whatever our difference shouldnt make us kill our honor we need no war but spread gods word its the only way we heal our world

whod heard from a woman
saying
i cant hear what im hearing
but i hear its your undoing
when carpenters hammer
and chisel your glamor
i will lend you a tool
and carve sculpture

kindness can be cruel

man i knew a man who knew a man
whod once loved a woman
and she said
man i wouldnt know that man
knowing what i know hes doing
my best friends
live for their own ends
id take your bullet in a duel
better i bleed

kindness can be cruel

i dont know what to be

its not so easy to find out later
about the necessary knowledge for survival
you think you know enough to get you through life
but find out too late of chances passed by

an early start is not so important
but timing is most essential
opportunity gone is gone forever
you never know how much it could have been

and once gone gone forever
you will find out to your cost

a better use can be made of your time

and dont think that life is easy
you may never get a lucky break
theyll put you down cold and unknown
a total failure from womb to grave

on las cuevas boulevard
there she works her fingers hard
playing castanets and swaying
to a steel drum in the dark
she wears flowers in her hair
sings calypso in the square
people calling out the windows
to the gypsy girl down there

all day long
she waits for
him to come
and night to fall

she goes
underneath the colored lights
where the carnival is flashing bright
the boulevard just heating up
her gypsy heart

there he waits beneath the stars
on las cuevas boulevard
she falls into her lovers arms
sweet gypsy heart

like a satellite they spin
her gold scarf against his skin
her toes tapping on the table
like shes dancing just for him

red maracas in his hand
he lifts her up then back again
turning round and round in circles
to the rhythm of the band just until
the sun comes up
just until
shes had enough

she goes
underneath the colored lights
where the carnival is flashing bright
the boulevard just heating up
her gypsy heart

and you you were on fire the queen of my heart
and we we were on fire fire invincible team

when the rain pushed the summer away
i went back to our place and you were gone

dad always told me dont you cry when youre down

a heart thats broke is a heart thats been loved

when i fell down youd be there holding me up
spread your wings as you go
and when god takes you back well say hallelujah
youre home

i fluffed the pillows made the beds stacked the chairs up
folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
john says hed drive then put his hand on my cheek
and wiped a tear from the side of my face

i hope that i see the world as you did cause i know
a life with love is a life thats been lived

so ill sing hallelujah
you were an angel in the shape of my mum

spread your wings as you go

id like to take her home
but no one walks where she does
she goes into the cold
wearing two unmatched gloves

is it that a change of scene is all she needs
maybe its something she works out alone
and if i dont hold her up
will she just fall down

she says she feels fine
she says she feels right at home
but i can hear her cry
when i leave the room oh

is it that a change of scene is all she needs
maybe its something she works out alone
and if i dont hold her up
will she just fall down

well some essential part
is missing that i just cant replace
i know that these things are a matter of grace

and on her birthday i
get a watch to keep her time
and ill stay up with her
when she forgets to wind it

is it that a change of scene is all she needs
maybe its something she works out alone
she says that she only needs a change of heart
but too bad that parts alone are not enough

and if i dont hold her up
and if i dont hold her up

a man hurts a woman and a woman hurts a man
when neither one of them will love and understaaaaand
and take it with a grain of salt

a little bit of love is better than no love
even the bad love is better than no love

no love at all is a poor old man
standin on the corner with his hat in his hand
and no place to go hes feelin low
no love at all is a child in the street
dodgin traffic and beggin to eat on a tenement row
and thats a long row to hoe
no love at all is a troubled young girl
standin on a bridge at the end of the wororororld
and its a pretty short fall
now people believe me

a little bit of love is better than no love
even the bad love is better than no love

you take a deep breath and you walk through the doors

try and stay out of everybodys way

its your freshman year and youre gonna be here
for the next four years in this town
hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
you know i havent seen you around before

cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
youre gonna believe them
and when youre fifteen feeling like theres nothing to figure out
well count to ten take it in
this is life before you know who youre gonna be
fifteen

you sit in class next to a redhead named abigail
and soon enough youre best friends
laughing at the other girls who think theyre so cool
well be outta here as soon as we can

and then youre on your very first date and hes got a car
and youre feeling like flying
and youre mommas waiting up and youre thinking hes the one
and youre dancing round your room when the night endswhen the night ends

cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
youre gonna believe them
when youre fifteen and your first kiss
makes your head spin round
but in your life youll do things greater than
dating the boy on the football team
but i didnt know it at fifteen

when all you wanted was to be wanted
wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

back then i swore i was gonna marry him someday
but i realized some bigger dreams of mine
and abigail gave everything she had to a boy
who changed his mind and we both cried

cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
youre gonna believe them
and when youre fifteen dont forget to look before you fall
ive found time can heal most anything
and you just might find who youre supposed to be
i didnt know who i was supposed to be at fifteen

your very first day
take a deep breath girl
take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

i know that you want me to dream
and i dont mind dreaming
but if its all a waste
if your heart wont breathe
ill choose to stay awake
and make a mess
heres my blank confession
the sun in me will die if you bottom out
so while smiles dont stick around

ill be here
if you want me
ill be here
if you need me
ill be hanging on a cloud of open invitation
holding on to that keeping you here

sounds like a roof came down on you
left windows nagging
and you were edged between getting away
and feeling slapped and blue
heres a song that will never be too far
my love protest of how i care
so while you feel that youre caught there

ill be here
if you want me
ill be here
if you need me
ill be hanging on a cloud of open invitation
holding on to that keeping you here
ill be here

i know that you want me to dream

ill choose to stay awake

but something happened on the way to heaven
it got a hold of me and wouldnt let go
and i want you back
how many times do i have to say im sorry

you can run and you can hide
but im not leaving less you come with me
weve had our problems but im on your side
youre all i need please believe in me

weve had our problems but im on your side

a spotlights shining brightly
on my face
and i cant see a thing
and yet i feel you looking my way

an empty stage
with nothing but this girl
whos singing this simple melody
and wearing her heart on her sleeve
and right now

chorus
i have you
for a moment i can tell ive got you
cause your lips dont move
and something is happening
cause your eyes tell me the truth
ive put a spell over you

beauty emanates from every word that you say
and capture the deepest thoughts
in the purest and simplest of ways
but you see
im not that graceful like you
nor am i as eloquent
but just a simple melody
can change the way that you see me
and right now

chorus

all my life i stumble
but up here i am just perfect
perfect as ill ever be

chorus

he said ill love you til i die
she told him youll forget in time
as the years went slowly by
she still preyed upon his mind

he kept her picture on his wall
went half crazy now and then
he still loved her through it all
hoping shed come back again

kept some letters by his bed
dated 
he had underlined in red
every single i love you

i went to see him just today
oh but i didnt see no tears
all dressed up to go away
first time id seen him smile in years

he stopped loving her today
they placed a wreath upon his door
and soon theyll carry him away
he stopped loving her today

you know she came to see him one last time
oh and we all wondered if she would
and it kept running through my mind
this time hes over her for good

he stopped loving her today
they placed a wreath upon his door
and soon theyll carry him away
he stopped loving her today

ive walked down long roads that seem to have no end at all
you never wanted time to end
to let my life offend
its time to realize what hides deep inside holy eyes

right on to you run away my love

it can pull you far away from home
with a dream in your heart youre never alone
dreams turn into dust and blow away
and there you are without a friend
you pack your car and ride away

theyve split us into sections

im from mars and your from venus

nothin is defined

shifts and caresses the buildings

dark starry eyes
searching the skies
because its hidden from view
dont mean it isnt for you

weve only gotta take it
cos its a dark dark sky
holds the north star high
and guides us and bathes us
in stillness and sameness and blue

ive made a big decision
in the light of the eternal
im gonna be your mirror
and you can mirror me
ill see you in the bright star

cushioned by the dark sky
reflected in the river
flowing to the sea
and as the reasons and rumors recede
dyin on the lessening breeze

sweet starry eyes
immune to surprise
because its hidden from view
dont mean it isnt for you

as clusters of heavenly jewels
gaze down on earths lonely fools
turnin and twistin
resisting the pull of a fate thats already planned

poor old grandad i laughed at all his words
i thought he was a bitter man
he spoke of womens ways
theyll trap you then they use you before you even know
for love is blind and youre far too kind
dont ever let it show

i wish that i knew what i know now
when i was younger
i wish that i knew what i know now
when i was stronger

the cancan such a pretty show
will steal your heart away
but backstage back on earth again
the dressing rooms are grey
they come on strong and it aint too long
for they make you feel a man
but love is blind and you soon will find
youre just a boy again joana

when you want her lips you get her cheek
makes you wonder where you are
if you want some more then shes fast asleep
leaves you twinkling with the stars

poor young grandson theres nothing i can say
youll have to learn just like me
and thats the hardest way ooh la la

heartbreak lullaby
in the still of the night
i can almost feel you lying next to me
like it used to be

and its hard to let go
when theres always something there reminding me
how things could be
ive tried to get you off my mind
ive tried to play my part

but every time i close my eyes
youre still inside my heart
why cant i laugh
why must i cry

every time we say goodbye
why does it rain
here in my heart
everyday that were apart

why cant it be
just you and me
what will it take to make you see
these are the words

to my heartbreak lullaby
like the stars in the sky
you still keep on shining down youre light on me
but out of reach

and i know that in time
you will come back to your senses
see the signs
and change your mind

i try to look the other way
and keep my heart on hold
but every time im close to you
i lose my selfcontrol

why cant i laugh
why must i cry
every time we say goodbye
why does it rain

here in my heart
everyday that were apart
why cant it be
just you and me

what will it take to make you see
these are the words
to my heartbreak lullaby
why cant i laugh

why must i cry
give me just one good reason why
why does it rain
here in my heart

everyday that were apart
why cant it be
just you and me

youre in the crashing of the windows

shall we agree that just this once
gonna change my life
until its just as tiny or
important as you like

and in time we wont even recall that we spoke
words that turned out to be as big as smoke
like smoke disappears in the air
theres always something smoldering somewhere

i know it dont make a difference to you
but oh it sure made a difference to me
youll see me off in the distance i hope
at the other end at the other end of the telescope

there was a time not long ago
i dreamt that the world was flat
and all the colors bled away
and that was that

and in time i could only believe in one thing
the sky was just phosphorus stars hung on strings
and you swore that theyd always be mine
when you can pull them down anytime

i know it dont make a difference to you
but oh it sure made a difference to me
youll see me off in the distance i hope
at the other end at the other end of the telescope

there there baby now dont say a word
dont say a word
lie down baby your vision is blurred
your vision is blurred
your head is so sore from all of that thinking
i dont want to hurt you now
but i think youre shrinking
i think youre shrinking shrinking

youre half naked ambition and
youre half out of your wits
and though your wristwatch always works
your necktie never fits

now its so hard to pick the receiver up and
when i call i never noticed you could be so small
the answer was under your nose
but the question never arose

i know it dont make a difference to you
but oh it sure made a difference to me
when you find me here at the end of my rope
when the head and heart of it finally elope
you can see us off in the distance i hope
at the other end at the other end of the telescope

i dont know why i went missing
it could have been the call of night
it could have been a change of mind
i dont know why i went missing
and though lost i found myself
where i had been all the time

when the clock chimes i shall be gone
but judge not the action but what went wrong
im no saint but im no sinner
thats one of the reasons why i went missing

took me off to somewhere nice
a night at half bored in paradise

they say for everyone
theres that certain one
out there somewhere
id been looking hard
searching every heart
getting nowhere
didnt know i was making
my way to you

now i know how the river feels
when it reaches the sea
and finally finds the place
it was always meant to be
holding fast home at last
knowing the journeys through
lying here with you
i know how the river feels

miles of loneliness
now makes perfect sense
here beside you
tears like water fall
it was worth it all
just to find you
and yours are the last arms
ill run to

now i know how the river feels
when it reaches the sea
and finally finds the place
it was always meant to be
holding fast home at last
knowing the journeys through
lying here with you
i know how the river feels

this is how society drags us down
with expectations around everything that we could imagine
weve been doing this for a long time
has it ever gone any other way no

our eyes are glued to these channels
 
we talk of information
anywhere anytime anywhere anytime

these days we live on the screen
these days we live on the screen
on the screen
we share our lives through the screen
and it isolates us from reality

the fear of being socially rejected
and we believe that perfection will protect us
from all their judgements
those false assumptions

ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh

the plastic cricket bat your brother found

they say get over here and get into the ring

if i had a world of my own everything would be nonsense
nothing would be what it is because everything would be what it isnt
and contrary wise everything what it is it wouldnt be
and what it wouldnt be it would

cats and rabbits would reside in fancy little houses
and be dressed in shoes and hats and trousers
in a world of my own
all the flowers would have very extra special powers
they would sit and talk to me for hours
when im lonely in a world of my own
thered be no birds lots of nice and friends howdydo birds
everyone would have a dozen bluebirds

within that world of my own
in a world of my own
in a world of my own my own
in a world of my own in a world of my own
in a world of my own

i could listen to a babbling brook
and hear a song that i could understand
i keep wishing it could be that way
i keep wishing it could be that way
i keep wishing it could be that way
because my world would be a wonderland

well when when ones lost i i suppose its
good advice to stay where you are until someone finds you
but but whod ever think to look for me here
good advice

i give myself very good advice but i very seldom follow it
that explains the trouble im always in
be patient is very good advice but the waiting makes me curious
and i love the change should something strange begin
well i went along my merry way and i never stopped to reason
i shouldve know thered be a price to pay some day
i do give myself very good advice but i very seldom follow it
will i ever learn to do the things i should
i do give myself very good advice but i very seldom follow it

leaky faucet dripping in the kitchen
rubber squealing  watch out in the alley
mr marleys probably late for work again
birdie singing  telling me to get up
such a soothing sound floating on the wind
i just keep listening

funny how you speak to me
in such mysterious ways

chorus
i can hear you
i can hear you
its so amazing how your voice keeps breaking through
i can hear you

theres a church bell ringing out the hour
like an old friend calling through my window
with the laughter of the children playing down below
youve got a way of getting my attention
in the rhythm of life everywhere i go
somehow you let me know

if ill only stop to listen
youre in everything

repeat chorus
i can hear you
i can hear you

how do you do i have missed you since you went away
i do my best not to think about you every day
just wanna know why youve gotta be the one that i love
i saw your picture in the paper just the other day
you looked so cool with all the girls and that guy whos gay
im on a diet of magazines and cigarettes
i lock my door and stay in bed
i dream of love in gold and red
it may be silly but i do it anyway
i think of you and what you said
whats going on inside my head
some days are made for smoking
i spend an hour a day on the telephone
i only call when im sure that youre not at home
but its so good just to hear your voice on the answering machine
i write  letters to you everyday
then i tear them apart and throw them away
and im sure that when i finish this one it will go the same way
i lock my door and stay in bed
i dream of love in gold and red
it may be silly but i do it anyway
i think of you and what you said
whats going on inside my head
some days are made for smoking
im not asking for much
all i want is your full attention
and your everlasting love
your true pure love
and youve got to believe that
i lock my door and stay in bed
i dream of love in gold and red
it may be silly but i do it anyway
i think of you and what you said
whats going on inside my head
some days are made for smoking

i had a dream of a place far away
i followed a river where the dead man would play
and im leaving in the morning

and i wont die so dont cry ill be home
those big black diamonds that lie there for me
by the tall white mountains which lie by the sea

and you a man whos as tall as the sky
followed a river where thousands have died
he was leaving in the morning

a crash of thunder
a brilliant flash of light
a battle has begun
and only one will win the fight
danger in the air

moon over the freeway catch us as we ride
we just left the city left it far behind
silhouettes of palm trees airplanes cross the moon
living in the moment of the girl who left too soon
its warm my favorite song comes on
lets roll the windows down and drive
it feels like summer is a comin round the corner
here she comes
brings us shells that listen to what we have to say
blows us summer kisses as she turns and walks away
there she goes there she goes
drive right on the night is young
we could drive on and on forever as the hours slip on by
they slip like perfect fitting sweaters
over shoulders cold from shortened days and wintry nights
left me in september i thought that she was gone
invited her to come again so she could tag along
barefoot on the pavement
warm against our feet
houses filled with music
as we drift through lonely streets

we were given so many prizes
we changed the desert into oasis
we built buildings of different lengths and sizes
and we felt so very satisfied
we bought and bought
we couldnt stop buying
we gave charity to the poor cause
we couldnt stand their crying
we thought we paid our dues
but in fact
to ourselves were just lying
oh
im walking with my head lowered in shame from my place
im walking with my head lowered from my race
yes its easy to blame everything on the west
when in fact all focus should be on ourselves
we were told what to buy and wed bought
we went to london paris and costa del sol
we made show we were seen in the most exlusive shops
yes we felt so very satisfied
we felt our money gave us infinite power
we forgot to teach our children about history and honor
we didnt have any time to lose
when we were were
so busy feeling so satisfied
im walking with my head lowered in shame from my place
im walking with my head lowered from my race
yes its easy to blame everything on the west
when in fact all focus should be on ourselves
we became the visuals without a soul
despite the heat
our homes felt so empty and cold
to fill the emptiness
we bought and bought
maybe all the fancy cars
and bling will make us feel satisfied
my dear brother and sister
its time to change inside
open your eyes
dont throw away whats right aside
before the day comes
when theres nowhere to run and hide
now ask yourself cause allahs watching you
is he satisfied
is allah satisfied

spiraling and trembling
the snowflakes tumble down
fluttering like angel wings
like diamonds on the ground
autumn leaves are gone now
winter winds blow cold
but id dance through december
with your hand to hold
oh its you i miss the most
every time it snows
carollers and revellers
their songs are bittersweet
the streets are full but they cant fill
the emptiness in me
christmas lights are sparkling
still they lack a glow
everything reminds me
that youre too far from home
oh its you i miss the most
every time it snows
please come back regresso mi corazon
please come back
te extrano tanto mi amor
back to me my love te neccessito te quiero
i need you here regresso mi regresso mi
i cry frozen tears
spiraling and trembling
the snowflakes tumble down
fluttering like angel wings
they fall without a sound

my dedication is to my art
no education will buy my car
too much temptation and help too far away
we dress in black we wont be light
were so depressed we wear our shades at night
without the stress we just might fade away

we wanna party but we got no soul
we wanna start it blow our senses out of control
we wanna make it but we got no way
were gonna hate it but we might just fake it today
we wanna party but we have no love

disillusioned with my dreams
got life confused with my designer jeans
hey whats the use with hope too far away
were on the list in every line
were anarchists if we can get the time
without the shit we might just fade away

<s>
i watch you breathe i cannot sleep
i touch your hair i kiss your skin
and hope the morning sun wont wake you too soon
for when you wake and look at me
you never know you just might see
another boy who crept in your room
take your timethats what you told me
take your time
but i fell head first and i just dont know what to do

chorus
nothing looks the same in the light
only a fool like me would take to heart
the things you said you meant last night
nothing looks the same in the light
ill keep my feet firm on the ground
nothing looks the same in the light
theres danger in a stranger
with a warm hand and a kiss so right
nothing looks the same in the light
its been a pleasure  see you around

i watch the sun upon the sheets
i hear a car out on the street
and gently pull you close its over too soon
what can i do but wait and see
hold on to you please stay with me
because youre the first and i want to stay here with you

chorus

the buildup
lasted for days
lasted for weeks
lasted too long

our hero withdrew
when there was two
he could not choose one
so there was none

worn into the vaguely announced repeat x

chorus x
the spinning top made a sound
like a train across the valley
fading oh so quiet
but constant till it passed
over the ridge into the distances
written on your ticket
to remind you where to stop
and when to get off

<s>
i see a shining ocean
i see the sky so blue
i see a world in motion
can you see this too 

a little piece is dying
a little piece in you
why dont you understand

chorus
paintings in yellow
keep shining in my mind
dont know why
i just dont know why youre blind
ah paintings in yellow
keep shining in my heart
dont know how
but i try to make you see

i feel a warm wind blowing
i feel the sun and rain

for the love that im feeling
i rely and i count on you
why dont you understand
world is in your hand
can you hear me call

try and put your arms around
the  year old tree
climb up on a horse
and let it run full speed
take a look down at the world from  feet
on your next flight

watch a flock of birds
against the morning sun
close your eyes and listen
to the river run
catch a firefly in your hand
or a raindrop on your tongue
thats right

there is a god

how much proof do you need

plant a seed and see
what comes out of the ground
find the heartbeat on your babys ultrasound
in a few years hear it laughing
and dont it sound like a song

stop and think about
what you dont understand
things like life and love
and how the world began
hear the doctor say he cant explain it
but the cancer is gone

there is a god

science says its all just circumstance
like this whole worlds just an accident
but if you want to shoot that theory down

youve come a long way from just tv
from a distant voice to ecstasy
now you need to know whats on my mind
can i break your heart with every time
she gives no love and wont let go
and when she fails she tells you so
the perfect touch is cold and clean
she steals your soul when kissing the machine
her hand of love enshrouds my face
she moves and turns with rigid grace
the light reflection on her skin
the words repeat and draw me in
and what i say is what shell do
repeat the words i told her to
the perfect touch is cold and clean
she steals your soul when kissing the machine
i want you to want me
i need you to need me
i know that you love me
i want you to need me
destiny is sometimes cruel
then once again i am its fool
to give my heart to wires and steel
but what you get is what you feel
no flesh and blood can give you more
the key to love is at this door
the perfect touch was cold and clean
she steals your soul when kissing the machine
kissing the machine
kissing the machine
kissing the machine

take me somewhere nice
to some tired island
in your heart
called paradise

though we wander home
we both feel alone
like escapees
with no where to go

i can think of
a thousand ways
to get good and lost
beyond these hopeless day

where well rendezvous
out of the blue
and take a deep breath
just we two

and well be so far gone
the oars will row on
and we will happily wave
so long

if we hook a dream
and it tows it back down
this open stream
well say hello
oh oh
take us wherever you go

take me somewhere deep
cause im quite exhausted
and i need to sleep
or climb the great divide
or wake up beside myself
just to know im alive


pays me a visit
and drags my islands down
they sting like growing pains
iced in the veins of a guy
whos not ready to die

if i may be so bold
ill weather the cold
cause im not afraid to grow old

if we hook a dream
and it tows it back down
this open stream
well say hello
oh oh
take us wherever you go

im not so slow

theyre calling all the shots
they call and say they phoned
theyll call us lonely when were really just alone
and like a funny film its kinda cute
they bought the bullets and theres no one left to shoot

i hear your footsteps in the street
it wont be long before we meet
its obvious
just count me in and count me out and
ill be waiting for the shout
oblivious

when the bough broke we were crossing america
you with your stories and me hanging on
your hands on the wheel and your hair out the window
its counterfeit color danced in the september air
when the bough broke we were flirting with canada
you said prove that you love me and live with me there
and leave all of the frivolous back in america
you found true love in a picture that you saw somewhere
he took her hand they did cartwheels right into the air
and then they fell

with the bough broken were lost in america
driving in circles and circles and chasing our tails
you with your politics me hanging on
driving in circles and circles and circles and
i think i know of the picture that you saw somewhere
the fire below they did cartwheels right into the air
and then they fell
layers of concrete wont dampen the roar of the
chaos beneath those ninetysomething floors
and the weight of the waves as they crashed on the shore
left a cool breeze past the buildings
and so they fell
why cant you just sit there is all that i wanted to say
so were obsessed with celebrity and all the frivolity
and all the while gravitys pulling us straight into hell
and so we fell
my silence was broken through glorious peaks of montana
now this is america i muttered under my breath

i dont know how to make it stop no

i got a phobia when it comes to heights
even if its a first class flight
and as a kid i never really liked to climb
if you pushed me hard on a swing then id cry

if i had a dream that i was flying
then id wake up in a panic screaming

and now you take me up and away with you
push me out of the plane with no parachute
and now im gonna need somebody to catch me
its like im falling from the sky sky sky

and i need somebody to catch me

catch me when i come down down down down
when i come down down down down
when i come down down down down

when i come down down down down
when i come down

i never ever wanted to climb a ladder
and i never wanted a house in the hills
im comfortable living in a big high rise
cause in nightmares of getting killed
i never wanted to swim the water there was too deep
put me up on the roof you couldnt pay me to leave
even if i was bummin on the streets
you couldnt pay me to leave

and now you take me up and away with you
push me out of the plane with no parachute
and now im gonna need somebody to catch me
its like im falling from the sky sky sky
im falling from the sky sky sky
its like im falling form the sky sky sky
and i need somebody to catch me

catch me when i come down down down down
when i come down down down down
when i come down down down down
will you catch me

only a few seconds before i hit the ground
how do you expect me to fly when you are my wings

turned cartwheels cross the floor

as the ceiling flew away

and so it was that later
as the miller told his tale
that her face at first just ghostly
turned a whiter shade of pale

and the truth is plain to see
but i wandered through my playing cards
and i would not let her be
one of sixteen vestal virgins
who were leaving for the coast

it was the time of year just after the summers gone
when august and september just become memories of songs
to be put away with the summer clothes
and packed up in the attic for another year
we had decided to stay on for a few weeks more
although the season was over now the days were still warm
and seemed reluctant to five up and hand over to winter for another year

indian indian summer
her parents had rented a house on the shore
though i stared at her all summer we never really talked
in the end at the summers end
i wish we could turn it around and start it again
she shared a house with her sister and mother
it belonged to a painter who rented out for the summer
her father had already gone home
the days were quiet and we were both alone
intensified by the lack of competition
we walked along the ocean and put off decisions
to keep us from saying goodbye

indian indian summer
in the distance the city lights flickered in the bay
but any previous existence seemed a world away
in the end at the summers end
i wish we could turn around and start it again
indian indian summer
away from the magic could it ever be the same
i think i knew those days would never come again

because your bad of the heart

how could you be so cruel
you treat me like a fool
after all i did for you
you cut me like a blade
my trust is slowly fading
now i dont know what to do
i thought that when you gave me love
my life would start to change
instead i saw that i was wrong
my life was rearanged
how i wonder why
you just put my love aside
you threw me in the gutter and you left me there to lie

you never wanted to start
cause your just bad of the heart
you never played the game to smart
cause you know your bad

when i was by your side
you kissed and told me lies
you hurt me each and everyday
i made it through the night
lying to myself why did it have to be this way
i thought that when you gave me love

this is the touch that remembers
tonight could be the end
so lets go til the sunrise

our time is indestructible

we are gods tonight
eternal

we own the night
and when we come together
we shake up the ground
underneath our feet
no one can say were too young
to decide that were gold
were the fires in the street

our time is indestructible
we are borderless lights in the sky
we are gods tonight
eternal

we are free to dream
this is our time
of our becoming

our time is indestructible

eternal

this is the night

to dive
to fall
to show
who we are

there will be another dream for me

youll still be the one

i will take my life into my hands
and i will use it
i will win the worship in their eyes
and i will lose it
i will have the things that i desire
and my passions flow like rivers through the sky
but after all the loves of my life
after all the loves of my life
ill be thinking of you

translation

in the middle of these woods theres a clown of circus at the bottom
it always watch everyone and tries to make them laugh
no matter what time if youre sad nor happy
i will try to please everyone
the truth is you must be concerned about this strange red nose i have
if you teased me it will never change
i just laughed when i fell down from dancing
and because i stumbled i also cried

just i cant say it that its dangerous
i have to do it who will do it but to you you just laugh
i dont want something dangerous like tightrope
but would you decide for me
cheer
do your best

in fact i know
that you have to practive
even if you stumbled for many times
that you even got frustrated
go do your best
just only your impatient feelings can be seen

i have seen it properly
that youre working hard
inside this circus theres some sleeping in their tents
but you have to remember the magic
so i wont force it to you
only this night today

just i cant say it that its dangerous
i have to do it who will do it but to you you just laugh
i dont want something dangerous like tightrope
but would you decide for me
cheer
do your best

just i cant say it that its dangerous
i have to do it who will do it but to you you just laugh

just i cant say it that its dangerous
i have to do it who will do it but to you you just laugh

i could see your words hang in the air
but they did not spell out what i thought that i heard
i could see the dude in your next room by himself
so i took one look around walked back out

now the snot has caked into my pants
its a good bet that it will soon turn to crystal form
so take it off and take it off again
as the crackers watch you take it off again

<s>
now here you go again
you say you want your freedom
well who am i to keep you down
its only right that you should
play the way you feel it
but listen carefully to the sound
of your loneliness
like a heartbeat drives you mad
in the stillness of remembering what you had
and what you lost
and what you had
and what you lost

yeah thunder only happens when its raining
players only love you when theyre playing
yeah women they will come and they will go
when the rain washes you clean youll know youll know

now here i go again i see the crystal visions
i keep my visions to myself
well its only me
who wants to wrap around your dreams
and have you any dreams youd like to sell
dreams of loneliness
like a heartbeat drives you mad
in the stillness of remembering what you had
and what you lost
what you had
and what you lost

something tells me
what lies ahead
will not be so easy now
its time to make a choice
ready up or meet your fate in flames
so what will it be
time to pick up some speed
ill make it so they remember me
living in fear is how
i choose not to live

never running in fear

take me away
i felt the burning beneath my skin
it took over my mind and erased the pain
resurrecting something from within
like a seed that blossoms
its like waking up
in a dream thats stuck in time
ive never felt so
ive never felt so alive
so alive

ive been to hell and back
ive seen the other side
never running for my life
i spit in the face of death

ten thousand people waiting for me
i can hear them outside from the curtain i sit behind
the drums kick in and the lights go down
my heartbeat drowns out the sound
my hands go up i sing my song
and a thousand voices sing along

i used to lay awake
hear a crowd roar to every word i say
now the stars they used to shine so bright
they were all replaced by candle lights
and it all makes it harder to find the places that we know

theres a tunnel that leads to the rivers of love
its sights make you bleed til youre white as a dove
dont bother to bring all the baggage you cling to
the porter will free you before you come through
the doorway that cleanses the darkness that mends
its easy to smile in the end

and it all comes down
to leaving it all behind and moving on
to the rivers of love
and never be lonely again
how long have you waited
how long til you drown

the rules and directions the twists and corrections
take tolls on the highs we still strive til we die
to seek out the one love the one that we dream of
the one may be there with you everyday
alone and untethered and free of all ties
free since the day you first cried

and it all comes down
to leaving it all behind and moving on
to the rivers of love
and never be lonely again
how long have you waited
how long til you drown

just dropped in i was driving past
you know i missed you since i saw you last
it gets lonely since you havent been around
little things dont make me cry
but still i think you could have told me why
you had to move out to the other side of town

ah you caught me out
ah you caught me out
but when i saw you walking out the door
you know i just couldnt take any more
i started crying

every night i lie awake
afraid what shape my dreams might take
i call your name out but i never hear a sound
you could say theres no love lost
but now i sit down and i count the cost
i wasnt ready to surrender what i found

ah you caught me out
ah you caught me out
but when i saw you walking out the door
you know i just couldnt take any more
i started crying

it doesnt seem theres any way
to say the things i wanna say
its too late for me to explain i love you

in a frozen night

in a world of our very own
far from space and time

i cant relive my life
i cant retrace my tracks
i cant undo whats done
there is no going back

i chased a selfish dream
did not survey the cost
illusions disappeared
ive found my innocence lost

some say its lessons learned
some say its a living life
i say its choices made
knowing wrong from right

one night i fought to sleep
in my slumber i turned and tossed
i woke to a cloudy day
and found my innocence lost

innocent child is a beautiful thing
secure in her fathers arms
sleeps while a mother sings

theres no way to know
all the harm this world can bring
i miss my innocence
oh to be innocent

my heavenly father
the way of eternal love
that overflows with grace
i can completely trust

my broken heart repaired
and all my sin forgot
i can be pure again
in spite of my innocence lost

in his eyes im a newborn child
cause i accept his love
i have a newfound hope
though ive found my innocence lost

i can be pure again

ive found my innocence lost

will i see you in september or lose you
to a summer love
<e>
<s>
there is a certain appeal to danger and pain
when she whispered those words i said
whats your name
right then i knew in my heart
that we shouldnt start
but there you go

could she mess up my mind
she looked so fine
i just had to know

so we got into her car
and drove to her place
we didnt stop making love
for thirty long days
until the telephone rang
my very soul she did command
all it took was her smile
the wink of her eye
the wave of her hand

so just imagine how im feeling right now
no word from her again today
did she follow that dream like a flaming star
i hope she hasnt gone to stay
i just wish that i could find a way
to make her hear these words somehow
i need you bad
<e>
<s>
damn
i dont do this for fun man
its my job dawg
all you see is the videos and the rings and the watch
and the bracelet and chains
and you know grills and more chains
another chain on top of that
and another ring on another finger and another grill
and then i switch grills and then i change chains
and thats all you see but you know

ey
i wake up early in the morning
hit the snooze button for hours
get up hop into a two hundred thousand dollar shower
brush my teeth when im out it
remote start the audi
kiss my boy kiss my girl kiss my wife and then im outtie

damn
grind time from a struggle to a hussle
aw mans to god damns
from a clam to a mussel
i aint say you had it better
but damn did i tussle
i aint have much
but if you tried to take it ill bust ya
it feels like i done died
cause every time i drive my past life flash
right in front of my eyes
cause im not one of them guys
that dont remember shit
cant even go home and drive alone in this whip
cause everybody want him gone
but you got me fucked up
if a nigga gon be on youtube saying
i aint from my bowin homes 

so im gonna keep goin strong
and let you niggas go out of season
as long as my kids is breathin
im doing this for a lot of reason
i do it for my kids and they kids kids
and when im dead they come to my grave
to tell me what they kids did yeah
imma tell em my style and how long i has hated on about it
and how it took twenty minutes to make a song about it
even though i was young i was actin grown about it
took some years but eventually they left me lone about it
old folks cheering me on cause they know i got it
they see niggas get in the game and fold like origami

but the only foldin im doin is when im at shows poppin
got em fainting like michael jackson straight hos droppin
then i go home safely homie theres no robbin
gated community
you gotta know the code partna
walk up to the crib
lamborghini look so proper
and six oldschools sittin on  choppas
white folks in my neighborhood think im the dalai lama
specially when i come outside like roo sticky dima 

but everything good gotta turn bad
its like the weekly drama
you know lil small shit
like girls saying they my baby mama
but this music has made me calmer
i now understand karma
these niggas is mad
they wanna assassinate me
like barack obama
but i graduated school of hard knocks summa cum laude

on the side of the stage

id give anything just to be with you again but its not the right time
and id give anything just to feel you on my skin
but its not the right time and itll never be the right time will it
it might never be the right time and thats the hardest part of it

i keep you in my mind even though youve gone
holding on to nothings easier than letting go
stuck in the memory of what has been
just please dont love another like you loved me
time doesnt heal it just leaves me asking why

id give anything just to be with you again but its not the right time

in your position set

all the experiences you made until yesterday
and your knowledge are only a burden
the wind will always pass by
and leave nothing behind

look for a new road
dont open someone elses map
when you raise your eyes that were looking at the ground youll become zero

are we dreaming
are we believing in future
afraid of nothing careless of whats our place
as reckless as we are
are we dreaming now
we should be as brand new as a child
lets tear off the chains that controlled us
change your mind
change your mind
we dont need to know anything beginner

adults failed and felt ashamed
and suffering has become their trauma
thinking they dont want to feel such pain again
they have become smart

challenges are laughed upon
what are you protecting with your silly calculations
in order to avoid risks

are we alive
do we want to be alive tomorrow
we pretend we understand we feign a knowing look
while we havent dreamed in a long while
yeah are we alive
arent we wasting our life
feel now the rhythm pulsing through your veins

stand up together
remember the day you were born
everyones a beginner
stand up right away
it wont go well
easily from the beginning
stand up together
you just need to go back to the beginning
a beginner again
stand up right away
be defiant be defiant
it will happen somehow
tear away the old page
come on lets begin
we can be reborn all the time

are we dreaming
are we believing in future
afraid of nothing careless of whats our place
as reckless as we are
are we dreaming now
we should be as brand new as a child
lets tear off the chains that controlled us

i cant do anything
i cant do it well
and so
were still young
i cant do anything
i cant do it right away
thats why we have possibilities

the rain has stopped
the wind has stopped
a light weve never seen before
is shining
nows the time

you are a reborn beginner

and im alone but in another way

i found a black bat tangled in a birch tree
if im a body youre a blanket on me
if im a forest youre the field at my feet
if im a corner that the dark backs into
youre the darkness that this corner clings to
if im the mountain with the moon above me

and barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons

instead of using their mind or their fist they put a gun in it
want to be a part of a clique dont know whos runnin it
tragedy on top of tragedy you know its killing me

so many people in agony this shouldnt have to be
too busy focusing on ourselves and not his majesty
there has to be some type of change for this day and age

were disrespecting each other
what happened to protecting each other
poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure

verse 
if youre feeling lost
feeling put down
trapped in a mess
or just fooled around
if your wish was a hope
and your hope was desire
when disaster appears through every corner
hold your feet to the ground
and close your eyes
if its meant to happen to you
thats the way of life

chorus
sometimes you win
sometimes you lose
sometimes you stay
and the other times you move
sometimes it rains but the sun
comes out tomorrow
sometimes happiness
sometimes sorrow

verse 
taking chances it seems so unlikely
to work in a way that you need it to
loving or leaving old memories
facing the hurt that is trapped in remembering
grab somebodys hand and
lift your head high
cos if youre meant to be hurt
thats the way of life

repeat chorus

how our hearts will find this light
take the chains off our hands
and free our minds for ever more
following the steps
the steps that are prepeared

i got a situation baby
i hope you can handle
the way my hands are shaking
when the director says action

i see your eyes and they start to move
they catch a hint of my selfishness
ill see it in you by the person you are in me and you forever
im simple like this just as simple can be its me and you forever
i said it before but i got to believe in me and you forever
i wanna see me with the person i am in you and me forever
a permanent reminder on the silver screen
may haunt me as tape is rolling
in sequence to my heartbeat

the only real love scene

chance allowed us to meet
but when all is said and done
it wasnt meant to be

the recollection of times we shared
i know our lives have changed
the memories remain
my carefree lover
chorus
she was a girl i knew back then
way back when there were no cares in my world
she was my friend
my carefree lover
it seems we were in love so free
but nothing never seems the way it used to be before
therell be no other
she will be my one and only carefree lover
she will be my only one
we talk the night through until dawn
impassioned by our thoughts and spending time alone
you never would drive home
until the birds would sing the morning had arrived
and how i reminisce the best days of our lives
my carefree lover

theres a wealth of things that i profess

and your selfrighteous pain
cause the only good inside your heart
is the good that jesus brings

and when the world begins to see you change
dont expect them to applaud
just keep your eyes on him and tell yourself
ive become the work of god

ive just found a chest some place out of reach

when no one else understands

i just close my eyes
and count to ten
breathing twice
and all be bent
nowhere to go cause ive been there before
in my mind it is near
i escape all i fear
so by closing my eyes
i am anywhere but here

theres no need for anger
religion or faith
one glade of grief
will always remain
its not on the paper
or a story book
its a place to reunite with all that was took
and open my i open my heart

where life is a eternal and ever green
the future of happiness ends silently
he loved and youre lost for now in eternity

one life with one love
are the things dreams are made of
two hearts a world apart
the music stopped before the dance could start

chorus
so goodbye now please dont cry
for now all the words have been spoken
time heals the heart thats broken
my love just walk away

we played those long days
you thought that we saw it the same way
you love as blind and if i seem unkind
oh i wish for you that i could change my mind

tormented to destruction by your own success
compounded when you realise your shallowness
you couldnt get arrested everythings a mess
a curious situation that needs some redress

theres no crime in being a trier
theres no crime in being too small
i dont wanna wee in your fire
theres no crime in being at all

theres no sense in being a liar
its time that you fell on your sword

come on baby do it in the oven
its time to turn the gas on
come on baby throw your body over
count up to three and then jump

you blew it you knew it
the bubble has burst
there aint nobody left to put the blame on

come on baby throw the number seven
i wanna get back home

i wanna climb out of the mire
i wanna come in from the storm
i dont wanna be a livewire
i dont wanna be here at all

theres no sense in being a liar
the fact is im totally bored

come on baby do it in the oven
its time to turn the gas on
come on baby throw your body over
count up to three and then jump

you blew it you knew it
the bubble has burst
there aint nobody left to put the blame on

come on baby throw the number seven
i wanna get back home

when your body hits the floor
all that pain will be no more
complete the circle left undone
by looking after number one

see the role that you fulfil
spoilt child of overkill
how could you have had so much
and not recognise the blessing

how sweet to be
with peace of mind
dont you see
im begging you please

another mile of silence while im
coming back to you

there are many in your life
and many still to be
since you are a shining light
theres many that youll see
but i have to deal with envy
when you choose the precious few
whove left their pride on the other side of
coming back to you

even in your arms i know
ill never get it right
even when you bend to give me
comfort in the night

johnny saw her riding on a street car named desire his fate was sealed
she could see him coming like a hundred other liars it was no big deal
rosa had streets
she was his possession like a jewel on his crown johnny better run better run

better hide your heart better hold on tight
say your prayers cause theres trouble tonight
when pride and love battle with desire
better hide your heart cause youre playing with fire

the ride was over but the story doesnt end he took her heart
she looked him in the eye and said they couldnt meet again
you could see the trouble start
the word went out that rosas messin with someone it was on the street
tito looked for johnny with a vengeance and a gun
johnny better run better run

better hide your heart better hold on tight
say your prayers cause theres trouble tonight
when pride and love battle with desire
better hide your heart cause youre playing with fire

johnnys holdin rosa on a rooftop in the night as time stood still
they couldnt hear him coming til he had them both in sight
you could feel a chill
a shot ran out like thunder and the blood was on her hands with nothing won
when someone lies dying lovers finally understand

better hide your heart better hold on tight
say your prayers cause theres trouble tonight
when pride and love battle with desire
better hide your heart cause youre playing with fire

you had your choice
and you chose to run
threw me away like one of your toys
left me alone with a bullet and a gun

before that the silence was driving me mad
with your words and razors this all ended bad

    

lets start the countdown
because im waiting for the end
no where to go no way around
because the ending was only a godsend

we were a time bomb
but baby you were the fuse
we were good but i expired
and i guess i ran out of use

i gave you my all
but it wasnt enough
it was just too long to wait
and i i just wasnt worth it

i close my eyes and see your face
from time spent together
you left me just in case
you could find something better

lock me away and swallow the key
advertise yourself where the whole world can see
single available ready and wild
body of a woman with the mind of a child
you bitch

id give it all again but theres nothing left to give
i dont want to be alive when you took my will to live x

lets start the countdown
because im waiting for the end
no where to go no way around
because the ending was only a godsend

we were a time bomb
but baby you were the fuse
we were good but i expired

immergee dans la nuit de lave 
etoile filante et nue sans entraves 
dans le chaos  se tord setire  et se dehanche 
luisant dans sa tenue elastique 
et je tombe patatras  dans la vapeur supertropicale 
je suis celui qui te bois et qui te devore 
ou tu veux  quand tu veux 

ces petits seins pharaoniques 
dansant comme des balles de plastiques 
tracent des huits des hierogliphes 
sur ma cervelle en ebulition 
et soudain jentends crier les lions 
les noirs jaguars et les gibbons mignons 
jentends claquer  larmee des fouets

here is a translation into english by lisa munns thanks lisa who disclaims these are not wordforword in some cases a little of my own interpretation has been added ive tried to make them make sense as much as is possible the verb pulser which is what i presume je pulse comes from is not in my large dictionary i think maybe it is something like thrust as the nd verse in primarily about sex and the chorus contains the words in and outany help also im really not sure about that starred line the verse says colles au plaf which is a shortening of a word beginning with plaf and i dont know what it is so i took it to be ceiling

moving in the night of lava lava night
shotting stars and darkness without hindrance
in the chaos twisting and stretching and swayingwiggling your hips
shiny in your stretchy clothing
and i fall crashing into the tropical air
i am that which you drink and that you devour
where do you want it when do you want it

these little pharaonic pharaoh like breasts
dance like plastic balls
tracing figureofeights hierogliphics
on my brain excited feverish
and i suddenly hear the lions roar
the black jaguars ie panthers and cute gibbons
i hear cracking the army of whips
there nearby in the forest

chorus
the jungleof limitless time
the junglein and out
i thrust and thrust again
i thrust in and out
guarded by the lights
poisoned by the black sun

i thrust and thrust again

its the moment of merging fusion
all hormones in communication
in the mixedup jumble
blinded by nightvision
glued to the ceiling rolling by the dozen	 i am highly unsure about
this translation
we take the eternal flame
in a circle of light electric
in a preorgasmic shudder

staring at a photograph of where we used to be
when the sky was bright and crystal clear and life was just a breeze
oh well now somethings taking you over
youre burning all your bridges and youre left without a clue
and you wonder why these memories keep staring back at you
oh well now dont look over your shoulder

sing for life sing for joy
sing for every man and woman girl or boy
sing a song a simple melody
sing out loud or just hum
sing for moments in the past and times to come
sing for history and destiny
wont you sing for me

standing at the station and you dont know where to go
youre trying hard to hold on to the world you used to know
oh well dont let it get to you baby

sing for life sing for joy
sing for every man and woman girl or boy
sing a song a simple melody
sing out loud or just hum
sing for moments in the past and times to come
sing for history and destiny

dont look back just keep moving on
get your feet and walk into a different zone
dont care what they say just let the music play
hey

sing a song a simple melody

i know if this keeps on youll be my ruin but i dont know why i keep loving you

you kissed my grateful skin
and left a chain of bites and bruises
im sorry when you grin
almost diamonds for the losers
ill swim inside your tears
and wander through your rooms of silence
the motive crystal clear
your tongue is love
and your heart is violence

almost diamonds
scratched perfection
almost diamonds
tears in glycerin

i spied you kissing her
you faked your love
my broken brother
everybody burn
secrets spill and smiles are smothered
you have to roll the dice
pain is two
and fire is sixes
vengeance feels nice
i know the shine
behind your tricks is

almost diamonds
scratched perfection
almost diamonds
tears in glycerin

who would have thought
it would end like this
you gave a stranger
a dangerous kiss
now your pretty eyes
say these precious lies
were just beautiful imitations

they were
almost diamonds
scratched perfection
almost diamonds
tears in glycerin

catch our teardrops
as they fall
you know we nearly
had it all
fallen tears of glycerin
gone is all of what we dream
almost diamonds
scratched perfection
dark reflections
love wont find us
only in dreams

ramble on about history dust off some old stories

i swear sometimes i can almost see
a picture of this small town back in 
everythings black and white
and theres dirt on the street
it dont look at all what im seein today

riding around
whats left of a small town
makin my rounds
waving hi to everyone around
its in my blood its where i settle down
lay me in the ground under whats left of a small town

you can still get a hair cut for less than ten bucks
if you go down to buds right off the square
its been almost  years since they closed down that old mill
thats what this whole town was built around
theres a couple old dirt roads
left down by old potts farm
we used to throw down hard out there man we never did no harm
well the counties offered thousands man that old potts wont give in
there development stops right at that barbed wire fence

lazy summer afternoon
screened in porch and nothin to do
i just kicked off my tennis shoes
slouchin in a plastic chair
rakin my fingers through my hair
i close my eyes and i leave them there
and i yawn and sigh and slowly fade away

deep enough to dream in brilliant colors
i have never seen
deep enough to join a billion people
for a wedding feast
deep enough to reach out and touch
the face of the one who made me
and oh the love i feel and oh the peace
do i ever have to wake up

awakened by a familiar sound
a clumsy fly is buzzin around
he bumps the screen and he tumbles down
he gathers about his wits and pride
and tries again for the hundredth time
cause freedom calls from the other side
and i smile and nod and slowly drift away

deep enough to dream in brilliant colors
i have never seen
deep enough to join a billion people
for a wedding feast
deep enough to reach out and touch
the face of the one who made me
and oh the love i feel and oh the peace
do i ever have to wake up

cause peace is pouring over my soul
see the lambs and the lions playin
i join in and i drink the music
holiness is the air im breathin
my faithful heroes break the bread
and answer all of my questions
not to mention what the streets are made of
my hearts held hostage by this love

and these brilliant colors i have never seen
i join a billion people for a wedding feast
and i reach out and touch the face of the one who made me
deep enough to dream in brilliant colors i have never seen
deep enough to join a billion people for a wedding feast
deep enough to reach out and touch the face of the one who made me
and oh the love i feel and oh the peace
do i ever have to wake up
do i ever have to wake up
do i really have to wake up now

it woke me up
its past two in the afternoon
its raining

my hair is a mess
a crumpled letter on the floor
a letter i wrote
and threw away last night

glasses with wine and the
whisky i drank last night
the cat is walking around
the ashtray full of
cigarette ends

i wonder why the war
is not over
i wonder why
theres still war

when i have a hangover
i dont need any music
i cant stand
any music

i went through my mail
threw a lot of letters away
had some tea
and the afternoon was over

i just stayed home
waiting for my new lover
whom i called
last night
but thinking of you

isnt war over
today
i dont think
war will end

why isnt
war over yet
why isnt
war over

i was invited
for dinner
to an expensive restaurant
where only rich people go

i dont think ill be wearing
the clothes i was wearing last night
ill put on new clothes
and go out
ill ask my rich friends
what does it
feel like
to be
rich 

i wonder if
war will be over

war will ever be over

i want to treat this feeling somehow

i know youre my love even though
sometimes i believe i will wake up
from this dream because love
i fly high above from the clouds
i reach out for you or is it too good to be true

because i know
things happen so fast
and it makes me low
because i feel that this wont last
but when you write that you yearn for me in the light
i feel that things are still quite alright
and then you say you think of me all the time
you know it makes my day
i feel like you are always behind
just tell me how i can hold onto this moment for now
i want to keep this feeling somehow

i know youre my love even though
sometimes i believe i will wake up
from this dream because love
i fly high above from the clouds
i reach out for you or is it too good to be true

just tell me how i can hold onto this moment for now
i want to treat this feeling somehow

i know youre my love even though
sometimes i believe i will wake up
from this dream because love
i fly high above from the clouds
i reach out for you or is it too good to be true

outside your room was where id lie
to hear those dylan tunes
in the afternoon
we never seemed to share a point of view
and thunderclouds were never far away
and every day
i guess you got those blues
and when you get those blues
theres nothing you can do

i wish four winds could blow you home
back to when wed sit and find a way

sometimes i want to get away from all the confusion

i know you wish you could run away from this institution
cause theres no solution to survive

another day when im waking up
i turn my tv on cnn
another homie done bit the dust my best friends back up in the pen
somebody hit the twin towersand the buildings came tumbling down
all we could do was watch in tears
while the people of america wondered how we let it go down
then i heard a sound when i turned around
this old man said pray for me
said ive been in the world for  long years and go now can you stay for me
i looked him in the eyes and gave him a smile and said mister i dont mean no harm
but you aint going nowhere so just pull up a chair
i got greens fresh off the farm
and with that he pulled a bottle from his pocket and said youngin ima give it a try
i said hold up pops i aint forget about the nana you promised so pass it by
and then he said

sometimes i want to get away from all the confusion

from dusk to dawn moms always tellin me you must move on
let the past be the last thing to dust you son
and i trust you mom
but the doesnt mean my lust for fun want to bust my gun
wasnt much to some then you measured up to most started walking down the road
to the treasure up the post
you just never fucking know what you gonna see where ya gonna be who you gonna meet
its true you gonna sleepin slip into silence
shot guns fired choppers and sirens

at a boy without a chance and the devil on his ass

the beggar took the baby
wrapped it in a shawl

next time you call

hard by lived a vain man
so vain and so proud
he walked on stilts
to be seen by the crowd

up above the chimney pots
tall as a mast
and all the people ran about
shouting till he passed

a splendid match surely
neighbours saw it plain
although she is so careless
although he is so vain

but the lady played bobcherry
did not see or care
as the vain man went by her
aloft in the air

lived and died apart

she looked cold and she shivered
even though the sun was shining down
life it roared on despite her
but she couldnt even hear the sound
i could tell by the wrinkled lines
like a map crisscrossing her face
she had seen much and i wondered
what had brought her here to this place

prechorus
its amazing what this life can put you through
yes it is
theres a choice to make in all the things you do

chorus
i wonder what brought her to this place
is it memories gone without a trace
seems as though shes lost in time and space
i wonder

v
she just stared straight ahead
like she was trying to concentrate
maybe if she could focus
she would open her memory floodgate
something strange seemed to possess her
and it would not let her go
searching deep down inside her
to find a feeling she had once known

prechorus
and i wonder what this life has put her through
yes i do
and i wish that there was something i could do for her

chorus out
i wonder what brought her to this place
is it memories gone without a trace
seems as though shes lost in time and space

i stood as tall as a mountain
i never really thought about the drop
i trod over rocks to get there
just so i could stand on top

clumsy and blind i stumbled
as i crawled through desert sands
i didnt stop to think about the consequences
as it came to pieces in my hands

tu tu are you tu tu are you tu tu are you tu
tu tu are you tu tu are you tu tu are you tu

i thought i was a maritime marvel
i believed that i ruled the waves
all i could say is time is motion
and every effort others made i would save

i was a shit stained statue
school children would stand in awe
i truly believed i was a ceiling of sky
never thought about having flaws

tu tu are you tu tu are you tu tu are you tu
tu tu are you tu tu are you tu tu are you tu

i felt as reverent as jesus
the sanctimony stunk
i thought i was admiral of the missing fleet
i couldnt see that i was sunk

i roared my pride in the darkness
i scratched away at the stars
i thought i was lord of this crappy jungle
i should have been put behind bars

tu tu are you tu tu are you tu tu are you tu
tu tu are you tu tu are you tu tu are you tu

but now i sit with my head in my hands
and wail to the weeping wall
the avalanche of my emotions
holds the audience of one enthralled

im learning the lesson the hard way
like a fall from command
i thought i was king of the whole wide world
but it just came to pieces in my hands

i will confess to you
because you made me think about the times
you turn the picture on to me and ill turn over
the vision was a masterpiece of comic timing
but you wouldnt laugh at all
and i wonder what the boy was thinking
the picture was an old collage of something classical
the model with a tragic air
because without a doubt hed given up the fight
the ghost of somebody at his side

i will confess to you
because i didnt think about the message
as i walked down the alleyway it was a sunday
and all my friends deserted me because you painted me
as the fraud i really was
and if you think you see with just your eyes youre mad
cause lisa learned a lot from putting on a blindfold
when she knew she had been bad
she met another blind kid at a fancy dress
it was the best sex she ever had

ill send a dress to you
because its needing badly taken in
but i was so embarressed when i missed your party
it was me that paid for it eventually
because you know how much i wanted
to meet your friend the star of stage and local press
the dream of all the bowlie boys that hang around here
and im no different from the rest
im not too proud to say that im okay with
the girl next door whos famous for showing her breasts

youre not impressed by me
but its a funny way for you to tell me
a whisper in a choir stall
the man was talking about you simultaneously
frankly i let my heavy eyelids flutter
because i have been sleeping badly lately
i know you were historical from all the books ive read
but i thought you could be bluffing
and with this chance ive missed i feel remiss
its days and months before i see you again

living next doors a challenge
things will never be the same again
i close my eyes and remember
a place in the sun where we used to live
now death is in my yard
hes sneaking around out there
hoping that i step on out
he longs for me
and someday we
will go downtown in his car

ask someone who knew me
they will never be the same again
they tell their lies and something dies
inside us all it makes me cry
even though i know that the ship would still sail on
long after im gone
gone
i will be gone

in this world of wisdom
no one ever really has a clue
they kill their lives
everyday
with what they say and what they do
but heaven knows i know
that the ship will still sail on
long after im gone
gone
i will be gone

are you going to leave me love
are you going to leave me
would you give up your own love true
to go with a girl you never knew

my true love stands in the bower door
combing down his yellow hair
his bonnie face i like to see
i wonder if my love thinks of me

when i wore my apron low
couldnt keep you from my door
but now my aprons to my shin
you pass me by and wont come in

i wish my baby it was born
smiling on his daddys knee
and i a poor girl dead and gone
and the green grass growing over me

now theres a bird in young church yard
they say hes blind and cannot see
i wish itd been the same with me
before i kept your company

i wish i wish but its all in vain
i wish i was a maid again
but a maid again i will never be
since that young man lay still with me

are you going to leave me love
are you going to leave me
would you give up your own love true
to go with a girl you never knew

such a feeling that you have missed
we are two in a million

i would tell you about the things
they put me through
the pain ive been subjected to
but the lord himself would blush
the countless feasts laid at my feet
forbidden fruits for me to eat
but i think your pulse would start to rush
now im not looking for absolution
forgiveness for the things i do
but before you come to any conclusions
try walking in my shoes
try walking in my shoes
youll stumble in my footsteps
keep the same appointments i kept
if you try walking in my shoes
if you try walking in my shoes
morality would frown upon
decency look down upon
the scapegoat fates made of me
but i promise now my judge and jurors
my intentions couldnt have been purer
my case is easy to see
im not looking for a clearer conscience
peace of mind after what ive been through
and before we talk of any repentance
try walking in my shoes
try walking in my shoes
youll stumble in my footsteps
keep the same appointments i kept
if you try walking in my shoes
if you try walking in my shoes
