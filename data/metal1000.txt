your time is coming tonight
youll be killed at the speed of light
destiny you cant fight
crushed by comets
transmogrified
deth will bring you new life
a slave forever on the planet of hell
eighty thousand years since the comet took
flight
your destiny is pain forever

the earthquakes
the clouded sky breathes fire
lava sprays onto the seas
the oceans boil
the deserts freeze

masses flee into the streets
meteors fly with a magnatized heat
crush and take human deceivers
fry the souls of the nonbelievers

smashing killing devouring all
no one is saved the chosen fall
run with the hordes trample the weak
crush the skulls of those that cant speak
sweating bleeding your eyes go wide
the earth is ending its about to collide
the clouds part the world goes black
the comet speeds forth for its final attack

oh venus the sweetest of them all

music by lord ahriman lyrics by emperor magus caligula

a darkened place beyond the eternal death
hung many victims chained lifeless
stolen of all their dignity
the dried blood on her pale skin
witness her beliefs
shes an apprentice of satan
the wind is blowing strong from the north
while the demons force their way through the flames
to grant her with their wisdom wide
inside the circle she feels safe
she can feel the power grow
shes an apprentice of satan

a sigh echoes through the woods
like a winter storm it spread through the maze
when shes finally embraced by the darkness
that she has finally welcomed into herlife

the wind cold as the full moon high in the darkened sky
carries a weak fragrance of blood
she can hear the demons call out her name
whispers in the shadows evil forces everywhere
the wind is blowing strong in the north
while the demons force their way through the flames
to grant her with eternal life
shes the evil messenger of satanic beliefs
shes an apprentice of satan

high in the sky flies the evil apprentice
she has turned to the dark side
with her beauty and her power of satan
she consumes the dead to get more life

high above all stands our evil apprentice
now seduced by the dark side
with the power of satan
she will never see the dawn until the end of time

a darkened place beyond the eternal death
hung many victims chained lifeless
stolen of all their dignity
the dried blood on her pale skin witness her beliefs
shes an apprentice of satan

shes an evil apprentice

that wont go away
a man from the mountains up north
he ripped of a smile from this little boys face

a little spark grew and the art of hating you

hold me father
embrace me with your ever smile
sole survivor
and shine upon me like a star

fear me pagan
as i am coming to end your life
the son of a murdered father lives inside of me
so bow for me pagan

and may the colour remind me of life once again
as it pours from the edge of my blade

a feeling still fresh in my memory
when you closed his eyes
you took out my light as well
turned heaven to hell

i swore i would find him and treat him the same

but i get no peace my heart can not rest

but its hard to do when the ravens are

why father
why didnt my pain go away

repulsive actions burning impressions on the soul
cascading wave of failure relinquish all control
the grasp of terror crushing a fleeting sense of hope
and then the same hand closes a casket for the soul

this affliction will finalize your sanity
to descension encompassing your very being
suffocation within the tomb behind
the eyes of a being aspiring to its demise
termination forsaken for the suffering
which embraces every fiber of your living being

in a tomb constructed for a tortured mind

drained of all sense and reason

invoking the dark and the moon of the night
summoning the beast forgotten tales
the angels slained the shades of life
as they spread the wings of death
screaming of fear destroyed my faith
howling beasts crimson tears

alone in the forest of dusk i ride
without one path where i could go
a place of ancient splendour rise
darkness falls upon my face

as creature as shadows once roaming that place
death lying waiting for my soul
deep in the shadows of night
she worshiped books for demonic dreams

deeper and deeper light was gone
feel embracement of the dark
at this point of time i know
prisoned in demonic dreams

deeper and deeper light was gone
feel embracement of the dark

centuries of dusk marching side by side
bleeding shadows of thy shrine

painfull screams devours my mind
serenades of angel tears
falling down from the bloodred sky

the sun has stopped shining light
just like a withering flower
slowly  fading away

ive seen the place where they meet i know where it lies
where ancient demons gather where angels die
the darkest pits of the abyss where flames burns bright
where satan reigns in terror theres eternal night
i invoke the elder to lead me into that place
drain myself from blood and drown in sulphur grace

i read the signs and blackened the earth with the magic of mine
i saw the gates of hell open wide

in the depths i arise in fury im led through hell
we perform unspeakable deeds were the ones who fell
in my hands the blades of death i wil take your life
then slit your throat with lucifers knife
im crowned with fire await my final turn
perish in flames burn burn burn

a land of darkness i saw it in a dream
a desolate landscape where evil reigns supreme
give to us your life i lead you to that place
of non existing light beoynd time and space
ill take you to the place where they meet show you where it lies
where satans soldiers gather where christians die
deep in my subconsious my enemies fall prey
the twisted and the wicked serve me and obey

you broke the deal of deals
and wasted what was given
to revel in your mess

underneath the mask youve buried yourself into
its coalblack
i am tired of the gulping that you do
every day a new face
what if i unscrew
your own identity
wouldnt you guess theres nothing left of you

the quicksand of life drags us
down into the circle
one day we might not catch you

breaking others down to try and to pursue
your own selfish interests
i am starting to get sick of you

whatever happened ever since you left
you make yourself and me look like fools

waiting for the sunrise
soul dancing in the dark
summer night city
walking in the moonlight
lovemaking in a park
summer night city

in the sun i feel like sleeping
i cant take it for too long
my impatience slowly creeping
up my spine and growing strong
i know whats waiting there for me
tonight im loose and fancyfree

when the night comes with the action
i just know its time to go
cant resist the strange attraction
from that giant dynamo
lots to take and lots to give
time to breath and time to live

waiting for the sunrise
soul dancing in the dark
summer night city
walking in the moonlight
lovemaking in a park
summer night city

its elusive
call it glitter
somehow something turns me on
some folks only see the litter
we dont miss them when theyre gone
i love the feeling in the air
my kind of people everywhere

when the night comes with the action
i just know its time to go
cant resist the strange attraction
from that giant dynamo
and tomorrow
when its dawning
and the first birds start to sing
in the pale light of the morning
nothings worth remembering
its a dream
its out of reach
scattered driftwood on the beach

waiting for the sunrise
soul dancing in the dark
summer night city
walking in the moonlight
lovemaking in a park
summer night city

cause the thing thats in effect

turns out to be respect

gotta get up

gotta get down
gotta put the fear

also weak in their minds
also fake also blind

lies and lust and hate

in the end its too late
all the tears that were wept

all the friendships that were swept

was it worth it was it swell

only time and death will tell

and we reach the final sum
after all is said and done

take your heart in your hand

and alone you will stand

soon theyll ask you to take their mark
to count you and make you do their deeds

murder and manslaughter ruled my life

no possibility to live with these rules i followed my wisdom
i have no regrets about my evil deeds this was the way to exist
wriggle my neck out of the noose could make an artist

my fate is decided life or death
i whil away the time with games of chess
i wished for a better end not to wait for my execution

so i was in a printinghouse in hell and
saw the method in which knowledge is
transmitted from generation to generation

as it had been told
and all of the words
were being swept away
by the wind
of stupidity
it seems to me

during your lifes darkest way
youre going to be bewitched by pain
so strong so youll have to eat your fear
until you die and disappear

by the way
during your lifes deepest road
you will have seen and heard a lot 
youre going to be bewitched by this
you will have given youll have missed

all of the sweetest dreams of yours
i wonder so what kind of whores
do you belong to ill try to guess
ive seen theres only chaos and mess

thats why theres only sleepy fire
of hunger curses and desire
and nothings done nobodys torn 
perhaps thou art bewitched whore

thou art bedevilled one

the veil of evening does fall down
with rustle its approaching now
the hollow  hearted voice of time
does make me sing to you a lullaby

there is no need to speak of the brothel in town
one whore who used to be an archbishop mistress
got a daughterinsin little one was called selinda
with the help of her priest she had left little one
under the shelter of orphanage of st john
she had died and begun looking for little one
but she looked ghost alike and it was real ghost

selinda selinda

come to me my sweet selinda
come to mummy little girl

run away
light escapeth from the grave 
make me breathe again my sentinel
ghostly aim 
i should find my little one
essay to hear me selinda

oh try to reach my hand selinda
i am dying for thine smile
come to me my sweet selinda

thou art my flesh my wish  thy sigh am i
awful nonsense stealeth my life
thou art my dream my essence  whore am i
our time doth slowly pass us by
every step doth push me down oh well
vanish fast thou art pretty well
coming closer to the hell
coming faster to the hell

only wrath shalt dislodge
ugly beast from his lair
thou may lose thy poor head
thy disgusting soul
but thy fears never leave thee
and they wilt be next to thee
they wilt be breathing indeed
till thy essence be freed

till you voyeur serrated crown of graves

may my essence appear
through pellucid array
of the ruptured daylight
with hiss dusk preys in glades
smothered by run of time 
nascent twilight empowered
deepest night to ascend
may the planets confer
may my spirit arise
from the dank filthy grave
may the night set aflame
cold stars upon the mire
of the cemetery

come to me my selinda
come to mummy selinda
oh no 
there is only your little head
in my trembling hands

come along with thy mummy in hell 
without thee i shalt drown in a bottomless well of
pain
i cannot be dead at all
i hae heard thy cry my little girl
oh no
this one is not of mine
this is someone else
my sweet daughter besides thee

where can i find thee little one
i should find thy place
and so let it be done

oh
i should find thy place my dearest 
i had found a lot but thee
try to reach thy paleblue fingers my selinda
come to mummy little girl

poor mortal whore
doth belong to eternity
having lost all the mind of her own
by the way shes bewitched
with some of luciferian spells
but doth not bewitched one
have a good time in hell
have a nice time in hell
it shalt arise from the tomb of itself
shalt be haunting for the aim
that is inaccessible

selinda here i am try to bereave
thy mother of her pain and her bequest selinda
i do belong now to eternity
as it should be with whore bewitched by thee
my daughter

selinda dear abandon gloomy sleep 
well fly away from here to an eternity

the jilemnice occultist

a classical operetta of three acts
the liberetto was written by mr scantisek storm
music by masters hammer a promenade
although also a chamber orchestra

the event took place under the slopes of the krkonose mountains
in the summer and autumn of the year  anno satanas

heroes
atrament  a student amateur occultist and adventurer
calamaria  a daughter of spiritus the landlord a well known medium
clement bombastus von satrapold  the new jilemnice captain
poebeldorf  the captains aidedecamp and a vile thief
blether  a groom of castles stabled and a denouncer
spiritus  a landlord of the jilemnice inn

a brief overview of the liberetto

we have emerged now in jilemnice in the year  and therefore in
the period when the popularity of spiritism brought bohemia by etrich
as early as  is at its peak at first it had been performed
mostly by kckonse weavers at trutnov but soon it spread all ober the
county and so from the very beginnung of the new century there had
been plentiful spiritistic seances at semily nova paka jelezny brod
and fielemnice attended by both young and old people  a physician
sits there along with the undertaker a clerk by the side of a
blacksmith a thief together with a gendarme the farming and
cosequently all of the economy is quite naturally being neglected
and the population demoralized
that is why the new jilemnice captain has been appointed he is
supposed to rid authorities of bothersome spiritists who have even
refused to pay taxes on the day captain is due to take over his
duties a prague student named atrament comes to jilemnice he is a
freethinker of a doubtful character but he is extraordinarilly
witty besides that he is thoroughly interested in spiritism

among the hills a winding way

spiritus inn does not indeed exhibit a bountiful splendour neither
does it host an exclusive society vigorous countryside people enjoy
themselves here the best they can in accord with their wallets and
intellects  which both are half empty they obtain their delight by
means of cheap liquors and racy talk standing out like an ametyst
jewel in a dungheap the passionate feeling between atrament and
calamaria begins to crystalize here the first night they spend
together is filled with eerie occult practices
approximately at the same moment a ceremonial feast is being held at
the jilemnice castle to welcome the new lord in his dominion
satrapold encounters the castles inferior and drinks liquor
specialities talking boastfully

i dont want sirs to pester your ears

the next day the duke goes hunting with his suite fiercely chasing a
a deer he loses his companions and in the growing darkness he falls
with his horse into a deep pit  the beartrap by pure chance
calamaria is strolling through the forest picking magic herbs as
soon as satrapold covered with numerous bruises manages to pull
himself out of the pit he sees a beautiful apparition in the silvery
haze of the forest scenery embroided with a thousand rays from the
setting sun a gleaming silhouette of an aetheric fairy resides with a
basket full of strange muck
during the first few momemnts satrapold think that these are the first
perceptions of his afterlife and he falls into furious melancholy but
then the beautiful with calamaria meticulously tretas his wounds and
he falls hopelessly in love with her although calamaria refuses his
offer to walk her home she accepts an invitation to the castle
satrapold thought does not have the slightest idea who she might
be

a dark forest spreads all around

that magnificent deer has vanished in the bush

in the morning satrapold calls blether the head groom of the castles
stables and tells him to saddle up a new horse the same day the two
of them are going to go to spiritus inn the occultist nest they
do so in disguise so that nobody will recognize them this is a new
technique of espionagesatrapold is shocked by calamarias presence
in the public house where she serves spirits with the wave of a
magic wand the captains consciousness vanishes and his body and soul
are flooded with an emotion completely opposed to the desire to
obliterate spiritism in the krkonose slopes

my captain

a few moments later satrapold due to his disguise is attacked by the
drunk atrament and blether offers his captain an excuse to imprison
atrament at the same time blether also tells satrapold in very plain
language who calamria is his explenation is quite naturally different
from satarpolds ideals and blether instantly falls into disgrace with
his captain in the coach he is slapped thoroughly and then in the
castle the captain in an attack of rage kicks him over a persion
rug

by the misery of fate im haunted

this aria concerns the most tragical character of the operetta it is
in its substance a confession of a man of deformed character and dicey
morals kicked over and humilitated blether hurries from the castle
to spiritus inn to offer his services to the spiritists since they
have already known him for some time he leaves misunderstood for
jelezny brod where he drinks like a fish well  for his whole life
he has been accustomed to serving some master blindly and so has life
suddenly lost all meaning for him this probably is the strongest of
the motives for his desperate suicide committed by jumping into the
wild jizera rapids from the riegers path pn his way from jelezny
brod uc
while blether is killing himself atrament passes the boring time in
jail by means of somnambulous sleep all of sudden he starts to draw
thoughtlessly strange patterns on the wall of his dungeon with a
broken brick  medial drawingsa praemurdial spirit reveals to him
that the man who poses as the captain satrapold is  just satrapolds
treacherous aide poebeldorf who devised a vile scheme with the
intention to steal jewels from the jilemnice castle and to flee to
cairo with enormous wealth he was sent to the jilemnice castle to
prepare everything for the arrival of the real satrapold who is
expected just tomorrow

oh my precious sir do you remember when

calamaria pays a visit to satrapold the false one in the castle and
after many minutes of cajoling poebeldorf he agrees to free atrament
but on the condition that she will go with poebeldorf to hunt later
that day this is so that he can kidnap her and take her along with
him on a horse which is already waiting in the stables with the
saddle bags full of stolen jewels

everything is just my whim

they leave for the castle dungeons to free atrament as soon as the
bars are open calamaria notices the drawings on the dungeon wall
from which she can clearly read what the villain poebeldorf has
schemed she does not hesitate to cast the accusation in his face and
he instantly pushes her into the cell and locks the bars in a panic
he runs into the stables where his horse is waiting with the
contraband intending to flee immediately that very moment he is
surprised by the fanfares announcing the real satrapols arrival
satrapold having inspected the dungeons learns the whole truth and
the situation turns to poebeldorfs disadvantage  he is put into the
prison instead of atrament

glory herr hauptmann

the operetta ends with a feast in spiritus public house it is
revealed that satarpold holds no grudge against spiritism

paradoxes of all time limitations of the mind
darkly looking through a mirror parallel distorted lines

all our knowledge and our plans every circumstance of man
all the wisdom that weve gathered never reaches the divine

wake the wonder of it all

hear the fools soliloquy cannot grasp it cannot be
life unfiltered and unfocused in a broken sanctuary

so we seek through every flaw and we contemplate in awe
ever trusting through the madness that one day we all shall see

some may rise some may fall wake the wonder of it all
raising seasons and kings hidden deep and secret things

giving to receive youll be exalted through humility
true freedom found through slavery
behold what a mystery
last shall be the first a living water for eternal thirst
two natures and a virgin birth all woven in this storys tapestry

die to live and live to die you lose it all to save your life
become a fool to be as wise and see when you close your eyes
saints shall serve to lead
and youll be strong when you are weakest
finding joy through trials and grief
it all shall be told upon the other side

some may rise some may fall
wake the wonder of it all
raising seasons and kings hidden deep and secret things
all shall bow at your throne for your ways are not our own
that you would hear my call in your holiness

music de feispursino lyrics de feis

far from paradise
where the winds of war
are blowing freely
in my tired eyes
run the bloody hosts
of ares slaughter
face to face with fear and death and hate
time to say goodbye draw your last breath
for i conquer

when i die
in your arms
one child born
to carry on

darling dont delay
for theyre rushing
from a thousand thrones now
cry another day
when the memory
brings you back the vision
tonight i die but my life is in you
on my way but i want to touch you want to love you

when i die
in your arms
one child born
to carry on

chorus
one nation one kingdom one child survives
one nation one kingdom one child survives
ill meet you again through the eyes of our son
remember to tell him the price we had to pay
and cry for pompeii cry for pompeii

repeat first strophe
when i die
in your arms
one child born
to carry on

chorus

ill meet you again through the eyes of our son
ill return
open the gates im coming home tonight
black tears will fall and the flames will crack the sky
oh i see you cry
im calling you open im coming home

seduced by the fire of power
blessed with the gift of deception
i will become the reigning master
fullfilling my desires for perfection

my strength is your comfort your shield and protection
your godly awe is my injection

so easy to tell you what you want to hear
even easier to hide my actions
using the gift of rhetoric
i drown you with my complications

through a perversion of liberty i offer you monarchy
in the name of reality i give you tyranny

by the filth i reign conquer and deceit
building my empire on your defeat
a mission a vision of a dark desire
using your fear as fuel for my fire

bow i am the master you are the puppet in my game
die i control your laughter you worship my name
clever as the fox strong as a beast
i am the puppeteer reigning on fear

i create the fear i produce the enemy
you give me pleasure and sovereignty
there are many truths i chose narcissistic one

lying there beside me
with your head resting on my arm
your body feels so warm
and your hair smells like a sunday morning

dont tell me goodnight
it makes me feel so empty inside
and if only i could i wouldnt sleep at all
dont tell me goodnight
just let me drift off slowly away and dream of you

you reach out and you touch me
just to let me know youre there
and i can feel your hair
and somehow i dont feel like sleeping

everybodys got their cross to bear
the cards were dealt life aint fair
its what you do with what you got
you can cry a little you can give a lot
theres always something to share
the miracle of love is all you need
to break the chains to set you free
and lately i see the loneliness will fade

falling like a river from your eyes
see the tears roll down another victim of the night
how far will people go
how long until it shows
that weve been hiding from the light

i want to know what love always meant to be
cause ive been blinded by the lie
ive come this far to find i dont know what i need
everyones got their cross to bear

calling in the middle of the night
when you need a friend cause something aint right
your heart is bought and sold
and now it leaves you cold

i want to know what love always meant to be
cause ive been blinded by the lie

glomeration of the fours constructiviness
an intelligental substance permanent
i sensed the elemental tenderness
in the mind in natures argument

to breed to grow to peak to be reborn
like a sine curve in an endless loop
the days crescendo dusk adorn
a process ending in the crescents droop

an example of what the substantial quartet can procreate
synchronized they operate

water feed earths production
while fire is fed by airs viability
which compose waters construction
the flux that strengthen earths ability

natures own artful methodology
where downfall becomes the interlude
laws which bases our current cosmology
completing the constant vicissitude

from stormbeaten mountains to calmrunning rivers
as old as the planets rotation
a work of an unknown intellact delivers
the symbiosis the perfect combination

water feed earths production
while fire is fed by airs viability
which compose waters construction
the flux that strengthen earths ability

still though provoken by a fifth force
a dark companion vacuum devastation
but somehow the harmony stays on course
with the quartets unity as profane creator

the result arrangements filtered through our eyes
several polarities evolveed into a symmetrical guise

listening to what you have to say

that spilled out through the years
and another day passes away

look to each day see the decay

controlled by labor printed paper and the corruptors of the world

spoonfeeding bullshit served by elite societies harnessing fear as a weapon

the time has come for all to see
the man behind the curtain cast into disease into disease

take back the light
its a dangerous place were headed for if we accept defeat
now we know its a show theyve been running from below
burn it down until the ground beneath the faulty entity is glistening
under the wings of a golden era
listening to the hate theyve created inside us we grow
as we reduce their religion to bones
yes we reduce them all to bones

the man behind the curtain writhe in self defeat defeat
when will the world seek truth within
the eye in silence grants the knowledge to begin to begin

reverse whats lost awake the song within you
rejoice aloud let these words imbue
reverse whats lost awake the song within you

pouring blood on the path theyve set in stone

your consciousness surrounded
by the reef of oblivion
prayers supplications are the only hope

the hope of survival
chance of salvation

behind the wall of tears

youll never hear own thoughts
you cant overcome your defeat

youve fallen down
fallen dawn

smashed into the rock of bitterness
you cant see the brightness
your feelings  behind the wall of obscurity

revelation of weakness
wasted ideals
walking the paths of hope

a hero was he
touching all our lives
as if he lived and died
in a single moment

great were his deeds
all his words were true
he lived and died
a man of honor

he paid with his life
for his life was the price
to pass the gates immortal

thy journey begins
with sword in the wind
stay thy hand rest thy command
for odins call was heard above them all
thy name shall never die

long shall we remember
he who walked the road of danger
master of revenge
deaths no stranger

blood and death lived on his sword
the god of war his only lord
into the depths of hell
go all he fell

take thy shield take thy sword
all thy weapons to the sky
ye shall need them when odin bid thee rise

for none but the brave
shall rise up from the grave
to see the valkyries fly

and so it was by the hand of odin
did the immortal warrior pass through
the gates of valhalla and into legend

rise brother rise pass valhallas gates
here great warriors await

reborn from thy steel
all thy wounds be healed

from the earth to the sky
now the son of odin rise

take thy place among the kings
for thy soul shall never die

the path to take and i walk it in pain
a darkened mind of destructive taste
my hateful seed grows stronger within
my own hatred  it burns deep inside
my eyes are blind to the demons within
my own hatred  i scream inside
my lips are sealed by the kiss of nondivine
my pain is drowning in the tears i cannot shed

my own hatred my trail of tears

my constant presence will torment my soul
like claws from the past in my eyes shredding tears

how light could be our darkest hour
none will be left when they come
to collect their blood debts
all accounts will run dry

a binary vessel full of nothing but dust
a vicious lust for control has turned us
into faceless pawns for faceless kings
shedding rivers of blood turned the color of lucre greed

whose hands were already too full of abused strength
and anger of abused strength and power

welcome to where time stands still
no one leaves and no one will
moon is full never seems to change
just labeled mentally deranged

dream the same thing every night
i see our freedom in my sight
no locked doors no windows barred
no things to make my brain seem scarred

sleep my friend and you will see
the dream is my reality
they keep me locked up in this cage
cant they see its why my brain says rage

sanitarium leave me be
sanitarium just leave me alone

build my fear of whats out there
can i breathe the open air
whisper things into my brain
assuring me that im insane

they think our heads are in their hands
but violent use brings violent plans
keep him tied it makes him well
hes getting better cant you tell

no more can they keep us in
listen damn it we will win
they see it right they see it well
but they think this saves us from our hell

sanitarium leave me be
sanitarium just leave me alone
sanitarium just leave me alone

fear of living on natives getting restless now
mutiny in the air got some death to do
mirror stares back hard kill its such a friendly word
seems the only way for reaching out again

so much to live for so much to die for
if only my heart had a home

sing what you cant say

hasten to drown into beautiful eyes
walk within my poetry this dying music
my love letter to nobody

never sigh for better world
its already composed played and told
every thought the music i write
everything a wish for the night

wrote for the eclipse wrote for the virgin
died for the beauty the one in the garden
created a kingdom reached for the wisdom
failed in becoming a god

never sigh

if you read this line remember not the hand that wrote it
remember only the verse songmakers cry the one without tears
for ive given this its strength and it has become my only strength
comforting home mothers lap chance for immortality
where being wanted became a thrill i never knew
the sweet piano writing down my life

teach me passion for i fear its gone
show me love hold the lorn
so much more i wanted to give to the ones who love me
im sorry

i live no more to shame nor me nor you

my head held high proud as a king
this was once my temple a vision that came true
and i had the wind beneath my wings

mighty men is suits create the future
with dollars signs on their twisted minds
this time there was no part in it for me

and the call is heard all around the world

so when the curtain falls
there is no seat saved for the broken hero

access access denied

access access denied

youth has passed me by and i was just a puppet
controlled by masters without soul
mr know it alls got the better of me
next time i wont take the fall

like a homeless child i walk through alleys
and i still cant find any peace of mind
so hard to recall if i feel it before

thinking back a while to the restless times
my minds made up i will strike back by dawn

there is no one there for the fallen hero

access access denied

tainted life

blind are their eyes

i could answer all
but they refuse to see the way
the lies of christ
keep them in disarray

they make a mockery
of what seems to have become of me

cover up their lies
avoid the truth i have inside

probing my dark mind
to see what they could find
on my pain they somehow seem to thrive
they live with no regrets
they think theyve cheated death
but now the truth has come alive

burning through the face

for everything you put me through when i was a kid
im gonna neglect you and disrespect you
and then ill reject you when you least expect me to

youll get your rights rejected and they wont be renewed
im gonna throw the first stone this time
hitting you hard when youre off guard and the revenge is mine

i wont break

fairy lady who stands on the walls
life is short and wait is long
the stars away dim with the dawn
fairy lady who stands on the walls

your tale has only begun
it comes from far the nowhereland
the wind is blowing a sound well known
fairy lady your love is long gone

oh darling hear my soul and heed my cry
cause all my crying may flood
a river in my heart

oh life is good
oh life is good
oh life is good
as good as you wish

pretty lady the horses are back
bringing joy and happiness
but all of a sudden the horses are gone
it was only the sound
of your heartbeat alone

oh darling hear my soul and heed my cry
cause all my crying may flood
an ocean in my heart

oh life is good
oh life is good
oh life is good
as good as a kiss

oh my darling now i cannot
halt my cries
my tears have drowned me
and i refuse to realise

whats left around me
its all so strange
its all so dark
im all alone here
to mend the pieces of my heart

little lady your tale has an end
for your love to the skies was sent
hes turned into sparks
that shine with the stars

and by night he will always be there
for his lady to stare
and thus hes never died

on my own lets face it thats all i ever known
whats left to show that i can break a foundation as quickly as it poured
but i still believe in things ive never seen
its bittersweet being homesick for places that dont exist to me

can we be honest to each other so i can tell the truth myself
weve all tried to please the world from inside our hollow shell

the safest arms are not my own
i cant carry the weight of what i cant even hold

can we be honest to each other so i can tell the truth myself
weve all tried to please the world from inside our hollow shell
im not satisfied with happiness not satisfied with hell
can we be honest to each other im not happy here with myself

counting down the hours till the sun comes up again a repeat of the yesterday that im stuck within maybe i need urgency maybe medicine its a hard pill to swallow when you feel like a raindrop in an ocean

can we be honest to each other so i can tell the truth myself
weve all tried to please the world from inside our hollow shell
im not satisfied with happiness not satisfied with hell

my dear ms sinclair you are my mother and a whore of evil
how could you leave me there in that old church why

my first vague memories of father dorian and me on my knees
he stole my boyhood early him and the other priests
while preaching i was dirty and needed to be cleansed

baptized my young face with soggy semen every evening while tears ran
alternated with violent whipping in gods name i was a child of shame

dorian he sodomized my weak and childish body
the cross went inside my ravished rear end and bent me open
those yellow teeth still haunt my dreams

caged from daylight inside a cellar he kept me locked up til pleasure he
craved
i know gods light is shining but this molested soul will never see a heaven
that i am certain of

my dear ms sinclair you are my mother and a whore of evil
how could you leave me there in that old church why

then one night i noticed hed forgotten to lock the doors and i saw my chance
i sneaked out and ran off foggy air morning dark the grass was wet
id been there for so long not sure of my age the wicked father d may he
burn in hell
you must die oh spiteful bitch you put me there

slowly she opened her eyes and stared at him silent at first
felt she was squeezing his hand the wrinkly old hag

ms sinclair
my dear boy my dear edward let me tell you of your past
please son ease down sit down and listen to me

i was born where you grew up daughter of father dorian
his line of blood runs deep deeper than you can possibly imagine

night after night he robbed me of pride
pleasing his need a child of his breed that never could smile
instead of playing with a dolly i had to play with him
in my mouth i can still taste his salt veiny skin

barely fertile yet daily raped his holy seed
finally my girly womb managed to impregnate
my father my lover had now made me a mother
as he delivered my baby i wept to god

i left the church right after my baby boy was born
i was replaced by my infant to be my fathers toy
that toy was you dear edward and im glad i left you there
our fathers love for his children can never be compared

through which youll never see
what hides inside this lonely man
who was born to live for eternity

ive been wearing a mask to hide

ive had enough i want to change
even if it sounds too strange
i want to get out this rusty cage
you cannot change till i say so
but i will never let you go

this fearful voice rulesover me
now through the walls i cannot see
i am a slave to the evils will
but i think ive already paid my bill

ill pull up now and be strong
i know all my life i have been wrong
it is high time to get things straight
i have no more time to wait

life has been a desperate struggle

i wonder where were going and how well survive
we all lost our souls
captives in our golden hive

and now is just too late
we cry and kneel down

trying to recover our lost faith we pray
waiting for a message from you god and we wait

we feel so lonely
can you ever forgive our shameful sin
i know that weve gone too far
were just waiting for you

life faded away
to a black pitch nightmare
the world rotting inside

got no feelings anymore to share with others
we dont even have the need to make new children

now that youve gone
and heavens gates are sealed
we cant breakthrough
now that youve gone
and you just let us free
to build our new atheist world

world where have we gone
we just sold all of our feelings
to our pride

just to say we are the rulers of this new earth
rulers of an empty world rulers of nothing

somewhere out there
someone said a new life is born
if it is true that means youre back to us
is there a hope we only just wait and see
only you can bring us back to life

a child was born somewhere out there after more than  thousands years
in his silence once again god is answering our calls

were not alone
thats what weve learnt from this
our missions done
together we walk
sure there something out there
but heres not the right place to find out

we walk the road
of this life so short and tough
if you walk with us
well wait til the end
together well melt with the dawn with the dawn

assigned to the demoralized

faraway echos accompany the dim lights of torches
old and mighty trees twine along the holy way of an ancient procession
simple but obscure songs are murmured in the deep arboreal temple
only two mighty blades shine in the reflection of fire
from our directions come the old sages each with his number and each carrying his ancestors
treasures
everything repeats as in an old prophecy marked by a vision donated by the spirit of nature
and nothing is quiet in the dark heart of the forest
its inhabitants voices
the breed of the trees and the mens mantra are part of a unique great ritual
nothing is quiet nothing
the four shining serpents slowly draw near to form a circle following the rhythm of
dark and deep rumbles like the heartbeats of a huge dragon as he is drawing near
everything wheels in an alchemist dance where the symbols will become laws preserved
by a family of sages the men of the oaks
four serpents united and became one circular serpents just one in the ancient nemeton
where each man was near his stones and symbols
now everything is silent in the large forest
and even the magical lights of the flames seem to burn out in the silence
in the circle of men and stones only the oldest one begins to sing a new but terrible prophecy

what comes as no surprise
to a jaded mind no less
insight comes from soothing grace
left to waiting days
another chord unstrummed

our secrets safe and sound
solid now unless it breaks in two
faithfully unbound
and none of this was ever built to last

with the paleness of a less than life
from a corner watching old paint dry
never once a break
into the self again
an endeavor that will flat or fail
what maturity comes to end
never one to face
another beat undone

our secrets safe and sound
solid now unless it breaks in two
faithfully unbound
and none of this was ever built to last

once again
another instant saved today
left a print that leads nowhere
never built to last
what makes it work
a part of life thatll make a weak heart grow
take it if youre willing to pay willing to kill
prepared to lay it down
just know that
the prayer the lord the weaker the prey
was never ever built to last
never ever built to last

featuring christopher lee

it was a good time for
all creatures of the earth
but fate decreed that the dark
prophecy of a demonknight
could bring a tragic end to this peace
scarring their lives forever
only one person could cross the
darklands surrounding hargor
and venture forth deep into
the caves of darkkunor
his is a name the world will never forget
he is dargor

the dark lies a secret he is sworn to return to avenge the lost divine wars

algalord arise greater than before
time of peace not of war
shouts of freedom from the castle walls
freedom in the land and hope for all
hope for all

into the silent dark forgotten
caves of darkkunor
deep in the secret book is awaiting
unholy warcry
nekron promised bloody terror
bringing death and pain
to the new world

from the rocky mountains
to the golden sea
to the barbarians sacred hills
from the icy north and misty lakes
to the walls of seth and elvish plains
all beware

into the silent dark forgotten
caves of darkkunor
deep in the secret book is awaiting
unholy warcry
nekron promised bloody terror
bringing death and pain
to the new world

torment pain and bloody rain
nekrons resurrection
they must kill the demon king
or fight another war

nekron would rule
in the unholy name of cosmic chaos
and this time he would reign supreme

he is kron krons disciple
he is sworn to return
to avenge the lost devine wars

there was only one who knew the way
he lived in the dark lonely caves
the demon of the night
could save the day
should they take a chance or run away
dargor was his name

into the silent dark forgotten
caves of darkkunor
deep in the secret book is awaiting
unholy warcry
now they swore to band together
on a sacred journey
called by fate time to be great
unholy warcry
nekron promised bloody terror
bringing death and pain
to the new world

i makes me sick that its hard to distinguish
an honest leader who preaches a cause
thats not made and not based
on the profit theyll receive from telling the world
what line divides you from the seeders
who sow without growing believers
you point and you judge
forgetting that their faith is molded by your lead
so where am i to find
a voice thats pure in urging me to climb
theres gotta be more theres gotta be peace
ive joined them and clawed at the ground for my feed
ive seen bloodshed but the words still remain
i left i fled i called i cursed
i changed from certain to searching
but nothing has answered deserving faith
you are not alone in the eye of the darkest storm
we are the lighthouse shining a lamp from the shore
to bring your journey home
you are not alone use this song to lead you home
we are whats left of the love that can pierce through the callous
life you spent undone
we are the legacy thats left to breathe the winds to sail you home
youre not alone
if you can hear this song
the battle has been won
dont go dont go
ive got to use your voice to light the way back home
cause i need to see i need to breathe
so much more than my kind is offering
where am i to find
the voice that keeps urging me to climb
i need to hear it again or ill lose sight of land and be swept past my chance
to survive
follow your pulse to the shallows
unleash your will to survive
make every step draw you closer
to be the hero youve always denied
where is your voice coming from
show me a sign i can trust
i need something more to believe in
a beacon or something to merit pressing on
you are not alone in the eye of the darkest storm
we are the lighthouse shining a lamp from the shore
to bring your journey home
you are not alone use this song to lead you home
we are whats left of the love that can pierce through the callous
life you spent undone
we are the legacy thats left to breathe the wind to sail you home
youre not alone
if you can hear this song
the battle has been won
spread wide your wings
let the draft lift you up
youve heard the call of the future flock
youre coming home

columbus wrote of awful things as he fortook the seas
and many men have spoke of doom aboard the flight 
the devils home some do preach a force beyond this world
a secret time thats part of us a place that is no good
explain the missing men lost throughout the years
and all the missing planes snatched from out of the sky
the triangle the legend lives a tale for all to read
an unknown force that makes us trust
the horrors we cant see
and what of the soldiers astray from their ships
as over  are gone
for where are the answers to all that is odd
turning all science undone
has alien life within our time marked the planet earth
do ufos come and go lighting up our sky
do they search and steal for their own world
the bodies of our kind
and do we know just who to trust
whats real and what are lies
the sea erupts the sky goes black the air is numb
the wind is full but cant we see are we blind
some time has passed since the last tale
of the triangles disease
but as before the doom will fall unto the haunted seas

is this the center of mind
for what has caused this to be
for now the other world sleeps

woe is the material
you are the just one
save me
peered much too deeply
into dark waters safety
intelligent genes of an actual agent
confused conflated
beware of intelligent electoral enslavement
now do you know what i mean
attention now on the obscene
transparent alchemical memes
much to hard to think
easy to say radical extremes
spewed out the mouth of the river in streams
in dreams where i see
in dreams where i see
river of blood
river of pride
deadly sin is the duty of someone
if not it be this one then the next tide
if not in the center then from the side
truth belt choking tight
dont let me forget the breastplate
the shield and sword to fight
feet shod with heavy soles
on this short walk of life
helmeted and robed with a tattered tunic
to stay warm in the night
with all this with all of this armor
i wish to tease no soul
i wish to tease i wish to tease no soul

see much evil
hear much evil
speak much evil
fear no evil

the truth in the shadows
our great disconnection from something
our great disconnect
its a beautiful thing
its a beautiful thing
on this short road
its a short road
your story is my gold

eventually theyll come
your name has been called
out for aeons
to claim the blood
and salvage what remains

for once weve seen the fragile nature
of things behind these windows
where nothing lives
and nothing ends

and seen what drives the hopeless
in between their closing yellowed walls

the day has come
you are the fatalist
the day has come
you are the fatalist
you walk on soil that dreams of blood

how can we fight fatigue
in prehistoric sorrow
when all is preordained
the cycle never ends

what once had been an endless realm
of possibility and dream
now laid to waste and ruin
laid to waste again
you wash your hands in blood

you squander time
we borrow from eternity
is it another lame excuse

the day has come
you are the fatalist
the day has come
you are the fatalist
you walk on soil that dreams of blood

you are the fatalist

if nothing changes
then nothing ends

your thoughts are broken
your reasoning is flawed
the defense is just an act
and lies are all youve got

you are the fatalist
you are the fatalist

how easy we can see
defeat behind your argument
the fatalistic smile

the day has come
you are the fatalist
the day has come
you are the fatalist
you walk on soil that dreams of blood

the day has come
the day has come
you walk the ground that screams for murder

the drum beats on as i fall in trance
stepping away from the endless dance
my enemies in the endless abyss
the snakes slithering out of the mist
no subtleties truth is all that i ask
no pleasantries you can take off that mask
this world has left me bruised and callous
empty heart is filled with malice
cold
a blackened hole where there was once a soul

no tender mercies here
endure and persevere
erase the obstacles that try to find me
fight through their ignorance
suffer my persistence
eclipse the light that will try to blind me

take me through the fire
and if you lift me up then i will follow
take me through the fire
so take me through the fire

too many voices fill the empty void
too many choices and were left devoid
the killing fields fill with bodies dead
the sun goes down and last rites are read
cause even now i keep my ear to the streets
and they whisper to me your deceits
you better sleep with one eye open
never let my name be spoken ill
dont make me send the lions out to kill

no tender mercies here

too low i fell i did not reach the stepfathers neck
although his visage seemed so close
with bony fingers i desired to clench the crown of thorns
in vain i have trampled the paradisical flower of love
and i trample its rights here on the earth

a daemon of the several thousand strong cavalery
not gods son i am but the child of million stars
while each of them symbolises different human fraility greater than mine

murder
i have been embraced by suffering
no longer human i stalk my prey
to kill and gut all surrounding me
humanity in me slips away

into the basement
my own private morgue
necrotic restants are left to devour
lunacy errupts from the world you breed
nothing survives as i consume my meat

depraved in my sea of cartilage
im draved in gore

i have been embraced by suffering
no longer human i stalk my prey
to kill and gut all surrounding me
my humanity slips from me

into the basement
my own private morgue
necrotic restants are left to devour
lunacy errupts from the world you breed
nothing survives as i consume my meat

severed head as ornament
my collection of the dead
punctured cranialwalls collapse
filled with acid
my aphrodisiac

i will not rest
until ive killed you all
i will not rest

until your head
hangs on the wall of suffering
no longer human it takes control
feelings overwhealming me
i have to rid the earth
of human anatomy

i will not rest until ive killed you all
exposed and gutted in my hall of gore
murder the world let the blood run free

infected by this disease called love
i must fill my private morgue
dissecting randomly
your voluptuous cadaver into soup ill render

can no longer bear this suffering
i am your god your tortured will
no longer human it takes control
destined to torture mutilate and destroy

a hamlet lord had taken me in
he was an elder lacking kin
his wing was mentorous and protective
the celestial erudition he was about to share

as a boy id learned much on my own
recognizing prewar signs and dialects
but lord elmreckt was a master intellectual
capable of feats unproven by science

the first step to understand the fear
to control the reflexes of mental lapse
following this the medicinary state
where expanding the mind is possible by the use of linear projection

and for long months i listened practiced and learned
my minds eye has transcended the scars of the earth
my awareness immense my instincts now honed
lord elmreckt and i were tapping into the unknown

and oh the sight and the sound
like a billion explosions but black and calm
and this alleged continuum of space and time
it is not at all like what is said in thr old worlds books

quiet he said we are travelling at a humungous speed
down an unchartable quarter of the astral sleet
it was so intense that i felt death grip me
toy with me follow me and then let me go

apparition there is a land far away across the violent sea
 solsti have passed since a dying and unearthly race
tried to cultivate there it is important that their work is completed
not for their sake but for yours

gigantic triangular structures bizarre glyphs and a

rob crews that snatch treasures
halt the global giant unfolds the science
unify blends the fire to the sea
i bring crisis and crucifixion with the newest scriptures
rugged who control hundreds
who stay cold blooded like anemics
paint pictures that keep minds twisted like spinal defects
spit jewels
watch your platoon
lick wounds

uncontrollable addict
on a downward spiral towards my mortal end and beginning
a dependence that i can never impede neither wanting nor able to
for i live and die for the compulsion
an experience few discover and even less wish to return from
troubled that it cant be shared
i must lead this life of seclusion to hide my continuous revealing crusade
far beyond a fixation it is now my lifes labor
rudimentary equipment is all i utilize
a device so simple yet so precise  an inaccuracy insures failure
guile yet effective for its only function
assisting the voyage
my life in the care of this specially crafted tool it is the only gray for me to return
i need to explore lain
there is s o much more to be known
strapped to the mechanism i prepare
essential wires attach restraints hold me into position
im ready
the flick of a switch steals the commencement
a controlled electric current is administered
the short lived pain i must pass through is a mere token price
clinically dead yet i feel so alive
here again i know to explore in haste  time is restricted
my natural physical casing is of no use here
a sensation so welcoming is overpowering
i must resist the urge to stay
turning away from the luminosity i see before me i look for new areas to explore
it feels vaguely different each time i come
could it be evolving
the only thing that is certain is that im being watched
concentrating i block out distractions
to tie in the increasing stream of thoughts emotions sensations
insinuating what this place actually is
it must be a gateway of sorts a collection point collecting at is now theirs
i know my time is almost up as i sense them approach
far i am the latest acquisition i can roughly make out their silhouette
but this is not hour it is supposed to be
agony indescribable hits rte
im pulled ungracefully from one reality to another
my journey complete as im artificially revived
i slump forward into unconsciousness
intense pain when i wake once more in the marl world
it is of little concern the knowledge gained is essential
i must return
there is s a much more to learnt must know what is really beyond
but i must rest my weak mortal shell

you were far too comfortable just leaving him for dead
and i patiently waited to send you away for the debt you refused to pay

dont beg for forgiveness cause your cries wont be heard
you underestimated my forewarning word
your secrets on the table as you hide underneath
oh youll hide underneath

you were far too comfortable just leaving him for dead

from an offset imbalance of membrane and cell

and though you try and try and try to pull me down
its all been lies its lies begat the lies again
im not afraid afraid of dying anymore
only i can set me free
so turn and blame but dont you fuckin look at me

its over its over

weve secretly replaced your pathetic existence with more pain
and anguish and suffering than one soul could possibly stomach
so fasten your noose and enjoy your ride
cos life is hell and then you die

and though you try and try and try to pull me down
its all been lies its lies begat the lies again
im not afraid afraid of dying anymore
only i can set me free
so turn and blame but dont you fuckin look at me

decompose you maggot
now youll shut the fuck up

through the storm of storms the aurora lights
in her swirling skies a wraith like ice
born to ride the cold winds of the north
cometh to freeze the grounds

release the arctic swarm to drag us down
spread its shivering wings caught us by its cold
with haunting frosty eyes it journeys fast
the cold will bring the fall

the arctic swarm
indestructible charm

the arctic swarm a fiend of frost and ice
gathering winds that howl in frosty lines
transatlantic travels a moss of cold
revenge on mankind

the arctic swarm
indestructible charm

deep cold green seas shivering masses
winds tide heavy waves of continental darkness
into the ice you see it devours all
unbreakable its ice walls are aghastic majestic sight

chaotic apocalypse a floating storm
on colossal powers all souls to the frozen world
into the ice you see it devours all
unbreakable its ice walls are eyes filled with ice

go seeing through souls of black
into absence of redemption
no signs of life in this desert of mankind
breathing out frames of dust
bodies lay in ash again
under skies of red
call welcome the end
striving for comfort while we slay
selfcreated glamour of disease
to the sound of mortal screams
we are burying one another

retribution  absolution go
in streams of blood
bathing in lust
a far cry from death

ruins of presence
damnation on hold
necropolis rise

the cities of the dead
a million spirits longing for rest
a pain unending
downward spirals light
a far cry from death

vanished future

necropolis rise

rise with bliss in my eyes
contemplating
educated perdition
cultivated death

i make my mind feel empty
the sleep is drawing near
then i pass into the world
that so many fear
i step inside the temple halls
a wet fog like the breath
of a dragon is surrounding
my body lifts me away

one thousand pallid deaths
inside these halls
one thousand pallid deaths
i hear their call

away through the halls where
bricks are made of bones
and the floors are made of bloody
slowly breathing flesh
then i see a throne
all covered with dust
it drags me closer oh will i dare
but suddenly i wake up

one thousand pallid deaths

behold lets vision take your heart

garden where iron like father
reminds brothers of their consanguinity averting bloodshed
where beasts tired of roaring rise and gaze at the sky
and are there so many of them cause they have a different vision of god

where low bird brings the gold of sunset
and all the might of its conflagration
lions dream having their faces on pads
garden garden where wolves lick cold iron
and the glance of a beast means more than wisdom itself

garden we haunt with ease
feral in the masses
garden manmade cosmos

where eagle falls downwards like idol from temple roof
and sometimes he seats with a wings so strangely spread
does it seem for him hes flying high over the mountains
or does he pray or is he hot

from a fireball we came crossed sea and mountain

laid the tasks and paid the price everything survives

lost in the depths of my fantastic world

none cares of misty source

rush rolling forth the vaults

our utmost foe is to be gone to rack and ruin

well destroy his path has been created
in such devious way
well shred apart array
of his false prophets led our flock astray

and if you please exert yourself to ride this trunk

our god prefers to dwell among the ruins
thus he does reveal his orifice obliquely
dilapidated mill shows no arrogance
we will make up our mind
to be akin those sacred trees

to dwell in silent grove
amid the trees with shining leaves and fruits
admire this sacred grove
make up your mind
to be as complaisant as you can

well ride our horses toward clouds
in defiance of roaring storm

all alone
from a ruin tomb in a forgotten land

oze
all alone he escaped myriad
of those spluttering saints
he left them all not resentful but dead
all alone he came softly up behind
no one sow
no one heard gloating over the senseless corpse
he has done this alone
all alone
fallen one leaves no victim undone
but no one ever knows

how did he strive
showing to demons their ways
strove to survive
for there was so much at stake
time nears the end

deep down thy art thou goest
painting thy dauby picture
looks like hell but does the same not a dreg

for prancing whorse of yours
only illgotten creatures
so they ought to be illspent

shine on brighter than the sun anon
chasing your hoaxhorizons
denizens of boggy path youve searched for
meant not to be led astray in anyway

as one would expect
hes left the gloomy wood for grove

the holy holt
he found his way into the heaven
again we have got our lord
in his place high above

all alone
from ruin tomb in a forgotten land
seen through the eyes of the dead
all alone
from ruin tomb in a forgotten land
you came so gloriously to be dead the only one

caacrinolaas
for fallen angels leave no victims
no their remains een
thus appear the hand of fallen one
to turn his concubine into the ruins
and reign and rule among the ruins he has done

the holy holt entering sacred grove
we have done this alone
all alone

caym
through the sweet eucharist of these trees
brothers do taste their gifts

the holy holt
holy oaks
youve been meant by our lord for us
like sacred trees
give us your life with wisdom of yours
it is not to be wondered at that
we are to become inaccessible for deadly curse
we shall win
with the acorn of life and religion inside
of our belly
thus inside our mind

well glorify all your ways

woah we have the power to change the world
woah with our love with our love

woah our voices will silence the end
because in silence there are always things to mend
woah as i walk to the edge of the world
my heart begins to sing again

woah we have the power to change the world
woah with our love with our love

avarice  gateway part i
convinced in a creed
its best to have more
the malicious greed
lurks behind this door

machining the greed
in material need

you materialistic fools
spinning voracious spools
fill a void with empty toys
heed upon the avid voice
within your edacity
we find your voracity
for your tenuous soul
not to fulfill the whole

incongruous drive
in covet and take
leeringly derive
avaricious rake

machining the greed
in material need

pangs of envy  gateway part ii
hunting prey for selfish pleasure
no bounds of lust will measure

more than before
less than ahead
a vacuum that roar
the task that misled

suffer the pangs of envy
the curtain of jealousy
a net that you have made
in moments that quickly fade

the sin of the moment cant confine
an emptiness you cant define

the jaundiced eye
with selfishness
loves joy you deny
with bitterness

in a copulate nature
the state of carnal feature
what you cant have youll take
becomes another mistake

paroxysm of wrath  gateway part iii
with fury you thrust
and anger to combust
a heart filled with hate
lies beyond the gate

angry and pained
wrath hes disdained

in your rampant
state of being
through eyes of rage
repugnant feeling

angry and pained
wrath hes disdained

in his bitter quests
he loathes and detests
in diffidence
in virulence
with asperity
and hostility
hostility

the ferocious scourge with caustic scorn
apogee reached enraged and torn

in his tenebrous misguided state
permeate with darkness thrust forth irate

the turpitude of compassion
rancor permeates in wan fashion

to pour the vials of wrath of this age
the paroxysm of towering rage

music dannov

the hands move painfully forward
times progression reminds you of the limit of yours
every second another step
towards the answers to questions no one wants to ask

kept alive by machines
your life has been gone from the moment you knew
living half dead asleep
this fragile shell finally overcome by life

the kids only know youre not well
the last visit they kissed you and said goodbye
they wont forget and soon wonder
where it was you went how can they see you again

kept alive by machines
your life has been gone from the moment you knew
living half dead asleep
this fragile shell finally overcome by life

by the bedside youll soon die

the machines wont save you just look at your flesh
swollen discolored putrid
youll soon be dead

the hands move painfully forward
times progression reminds you of the limit of yours
every second another step
towards the answers to questions no one wants to ask

as the seconds melt into death
we are relieved to not see pain on your face
the hands have moved into the dark
all lines are flat and you have moved onward

kept alive by machines
your life has been gone from the moment you knew
living half dead asleep
this fragile shell finally overcome by life

lyrics by jean schumacher

sound and fury
smoke and flames
how can all this be

studs and leather
hells whip flashing
coming down on me

ive stayed one step
ahead of time
but now the cracks of doom
snakes across my back
like lightning

burning bright
my soul is dying
watch out for the thunder

throw the lights upon me
like diamonds on the sky
music is my magic
and magic is my high

but still they keep on striking
those flaming whips of steel
wont you tell me
what you want from me

im running
im screaming
im fling like a fallen
angel for you
cant you feel my thunder

and theres no rest
for the wicked
no sleep for the metal demon
no rest for the wicked
till the black knight comes

not to concerned with deserting
all the differences everyones observing
take me away from the verdict
all the simpletons all our minds are blurring
raise the hands for the haunting
all the imbeciles everyone is running
put it all down til theres nothing
not repentance atleast you live with something

we will believe
whatever you think we need

everybodys scratching just to get to the surface
find their purpose in this wasted life
everybody wants to know their ending is worth it
that its worth it
its not wasted time

we dont believe in you zealot
we dont believe in you

taking a meal from the beggar
its already rotten and he doesnt even need it
who needs a sheep to be a shepherd
all is a waste because nobody can eat it
who needs knowledge from a prophet
scribble the words down but nobody will read it
sell the page to make a profit
speak the truth and yet nobody will eat it

we will believe
whatever you think we need

everybodys scratching just to get to the surface
find their purpose in this wasted life
everybody wants to know their ending is worth it
that its worth it
its not wasted time

we dont believe in you zealot
we dont believe in you

we are a
seller martyr and a trader
order harder and a beggar
you are a fools prophet and forsaker
we dont believe in you

you have deceived
with every breath you breathe

everybodys scratching just to get to the surface
find their purpose in this wasted life
everybody wants to know their ending is worth it
that its worth it
its not wasted time

we dont believe in you zealot
we dont believe in you

we dont believe in you

stalking through the black of night
unholy ghouls lust for blood
the human vampire in the crypt
the seek dead flesh to carry on
their morbid life no one can save
defiling the grave
cement bonds are torn away
the insane might they now display
their hunger for the stench of death
to violate the resting place
the unholy fiends the blood they crave
defiling the grave

ripping caskets inside out
the evil ghouls scream and shout
and dance with corpses in the night
devour the rotten flesh
the maggots crawl in the satans name
defiling the grave

from the pristine emerald seas of autumn sorrows
the giver of life weaves desolate tomorrows
we revere a kindred bond still bleeding
the histories of the hopeful
the everlast yet distant paths toward rapture
a refuge from the baleful

chorus
sons of charon  thou art my kindred veil
sons of charon  journeying beyond the rivers of death
sons of charon  into the thresholds of the unseen
sons of charon  thou art my kindred veil

fragile petals fragmented selves
deflowered by the gathering of unlight
a cacophony of wonderous lust meandering
in the blazing fires of darkness

raven dusk wings cast their shadows
all over the triviality of being
an eventide dissolving the emptiness of a haunting consciousness
the fragrant beauty of the unknown
still kindles the rancour of our rage
forever brethren in supplication thee we shall mourn

you can tell it to my face but i will never know what you mean
silence triggers the adrenaline some things are never meant to be seen

steel plate nailed into the corner
be sure that people know what it means
the room is empty yet so full of lives
not everything is what it seems

hesitating or speeding
its all just a bleeding way to be
heading down the same old road
thatll lead you to the place i see

ive been there

do you see
do you see me
do you see what i mean
be sure that

the sun never shines
behind door 
it gotta be cold
behind door 

eyes closed everythings at ease
i get to go where no one goes when alive
if youd seen the things ive seen
youd know that theres no way to survive

the sun never shines
behind door 
it gotta be cold
behind door 

this is peace of mind
behind door 
i feel so cold
behind door 

do you see
do you see me
do you see what i mean

count your blessings
count to eighteen
souls to perish
for a few stolen dreams only
as weve walked down the alley

the moment i laid eyes on you
i knew a close encounter was inevitable
now were alone
your eyes staring deep into my soul
together we sit in darkness

you know i want you
your voice sounds like a god in head
you know i am you
dont ask my name it dont matter at all
you know that love just aint my style
i feel the heat of your lust in the air
we have no choices left
as you walk into the vampires eyes

let me bring it to pain

you say your love is a spiritual thing
i hear you
you lick your lips like a lioness
i fear you
you touch me and my blood runs cold
am i the hunter or hunted
god put us here together tonight
you cant escape fate

let me bring it to pain

my tongue journeys deep inside you
your juices arouse me

dominate me rape me
your orgasm so wild its a trip

left to my world strange and unknown

far away far from my home

dreams go on one into one
never a doubt that you were beside me
still im strong i will go on
even though you have abandoned me
youve closed the door trapped my soul
but one day i will be free

just let me be here in my peace
where i can be alone with thoughts
no company just misery

cemeteries
well dig up the cemeteries
bomb all the missionaries
send the bones to the seminary
mix their blood with the virgin mary

turn their bones into the apothecary
so we can eat all the missionaries
their skin will hang along the flag of gary
for believing in the virgin mary

well dig up the cemeteries
that dont kill when they hit the prairie
the young will be made into the churns of gary
because their deaths dont matter
when they sing to mary

they wont vote
so they eat their very
young in the churns of gary
because when the gun is shot in the streets of gary
theyll be put in the cemetery
well taste the lead in the churns of gary
because their young dont think when the streets are very
riddled with shadows
looking for new for the churn of gary
looking for the new for the churn

looking for new for the churn of gary

the time has come to deny your ways
to rid ourselves of the parasites
shedding dead weight reclaiming whats ours
taking each moment with force again
no crosses to bear no time to be wasted

with no other choice but resistance
what will it take
you must choose or be chosen for

its all that we ask for what we demand
the decisions we make we will live by
proving your weakness

denouncing your claims

wrapped in twighlight from hereafter
so that you might know the flavour of that desire
destiny through dreams of sorrow
all life ends weak and hollow
and cannot know your tears of light shall remain

the skys alone told tales of fire
conspiracy of pain and desire
raping heavens to the thunders roar

oh dost thou
dost thou taste the languid sweetness of my love
for revenge of fire on heaven
of what has been left within
and the chaptered pain of horror
deeply sighs and spreads her wings
you shall hear me with your ears
that are deaf to spoken tongues
enchanting all forsaken
voices poisoning their lungs
and to be spoken forever
in webs of enshadowed destiny
they do not penetrate the conscious mind
reflecting sanity

drawing all life and light into them
leaveth thou in their turmoil draining again
the sound of emotion thy thunderous heart
and tethered forever in your thoughts from afar

beneath the veil of tears they wear
they see not clear enough to care
darkness seething avalon fore skys reap death and heavens tear
and speak in tongue of secrets told
of spirits kindred bought and sold
a kingdom beneath a veil of dark shalt remain

a token of thy graveless honour

and to remain in this forever
draped in darkness here together

severe malformations disfigured the child
embryonic displasia defaced him within
gristly stillborn floating into his tomb
uterine grave where foetus decays

corporal puzzle of twisted limbs
horrid amorphous extremeties
accessory members over wrong places
twoheaded baby with monstrous faces

interrupted gestation by abortive drugs

turned into a monster treated with foeticides

miscarriage monstrosity horrendous pathology

the little corpse is studied now
by doctors in the morgue
on a bloody embryonic autopsy
dilacerating its entrails
subsequently displaced
fragile members torn and mutilated

repulsive necropsy
craneotomy in two parts
separate the double brain
cutting joined heads thru the middle
union through out the thorax
vital organs ablated
soft spine brutally split open

recomposition after carnage
the babys body is mummified
erasing all the bodily scars
medical funeral in a chloroform jar

interrupted gestation by abortive drugs
has affected the growth of foetus
turned into a monster treated with foeticides
a new life is mangled forever

why it is so dark and cold
is this a dream or what
this place is so silent and calm
im left alone destined to rot
i hear them cry above me but why
im not dead suffer from this
premature burial
is this my final end

a slow death by suffocation
turns my dream into reality
end of my existence dead for all eternity
brutaly banished from life
a fear that grows inside
cast out of society because of my insanity

life in fear and misery
i dont want to live no more
end my pain let me die
strangle me nice and slow
soon im gone forever and no one cares why
a pain i cant den as im about to die

slowly the air fades out
and i know that i soon wll die
in pain i choke in fear i will die
a part of my body remains after death
opens the porthole for my eternal rest

take me away pull me over the edge
i dont want want this pain i just want my death
a slow death by suffocation
turns my dreams to reality
end of my fucking existence
dead for all eternity

do you remember the days
when living was meant to be free
not looking for fortune
not looking for fame
the beauty of life was the key
we lived as one to conquer the world
a thousand dreams to come true
we knew in the end well find
the meaning of life and the truth
once proud and full of passion
we formed a better world
we fought against oppression
and wisdom was our sword
on the path of glory
we searched the rainbows end
lives meant to share
wheres the sign that wed sent

on sad wings of destiny
were kings without a throne
if you believe in unity
believe cause youre not alone
sad wings of destiny
the haunting thoughts of pain
the worlds a patient majesty but believe
the time the time will take its toll
now its the time for a change
the days of your childhood are gone
the fool and the wise man
will burn at the stake
confusion remaining too long
violence and hate i wont see anymore
the innocent victims of fate
the prophets have written
their words on the wall
wake up before its too late
on the path of glory
we searched the rainbows end
lives meant to share
wheres the sign that wed sent
on sad wings of destiny
were kings without a throne

believe cause youre not alone

believe if you wont change your mind
all will remain the same
and soon well find a common end
on the path of glory
well search the rainbows end
lives meant to share
wheres the sign that wed sent
on sad wings of destiny
were kings without a throne
if you believe in unity
believe cause youre not alone

are you drowning in your tears
the time has come for you my friend
dont hide from evil made by your own hands
let us try to fly again
one day well rise again

blue textures cascade downward to the base of the monolith
like brush strokes on a canvas of souls
two arms reach out a cloak of silent nihil
revenants untouched by the scythe
they are lost in the dark woods of time

aloft in the landscape that you hail
i am the fog that seeps over here in the early hours

standing proud in the hollow of the land
a vestige of deeper purity etched in spirit against the sky

the menhir had runes carved in limbs of oaken sovereignty
and could see the ages growing from within the palms
i can feel the era slipping into oblivion
no longer grasping the textures
i am slowly becoming stone

as wolves celebrate the dusk
an old voice of wisdom haunts the vale

shapes flicker in the fire light through the windows
the woodlands burn with grace
their silence drowns the age

as wandering ghosts pass through the flames
a new age of rebirth lights the dawn

but who are they who pass by the window
the shapes like black solar wheels scorched in the snow
by gods of the stone
this elder stone shall never fall

cast the aeons into the void
so that no other can seek them
no age no hands shall taint them
pour the sorrows into the sun
they are lost forever in dark woods of time
carve the symbols into the stone
so that another can find them
no age no hands shall change them
pour the ages into the sun
they are lost forever in the dark woods of time

i am alone i am my own
do whatever i do
i am a man i am a god
a pauper just like you

all is well with the setting of the sun
all is well with the setting of the sun

cause to fight cause to die
for the glory of truth
cause to rise cause to fall
its all bitter yet true

teach to beg teach to rule
the master is not you
teach to love teach to hate
now wicked and cruel

lyrics by vincent bocchini

i been walking with feelings for days
not knowing what to do
everytime i see you again
it makes me wonder what youre going through

chorus

hold on hold on dont let go of it just yet
hold on hold on this is something you will forget

help me try to understand
the love you had has gone away
that left you high and dry
but dont let it take your life today

chorus

let me help you through today
and let your new life begin
before long the feeling will fade
youll go on living life again

when its time for us to overrun them
when the time has come to force a change
then its time for us to come together
then this time we see the future rearrange

damaged and desecrated
corrupted and controlled
conformed to one mans vision
pushed back against a wall

taking all from us and giving nothing
taking every freed mans rite
lies are covering truths perfection
lies are smothering in site

damaged and desecrated
corrupted and controlled
conformed to one mans vision
we are now condemned to fight

calling all the eyes and ears now open
calling all of us to stand and fight
overpowering the old repression
overpowering with a new insight

damaged and desecrated
corrupted and controlled
conformed to one mans vision
we are now condemned to fight

hearing all of this madmans grumbling
heading now the rebels call
victory now is ever present
victory now and forever more

lies cover truths perfection
lies smother all in site
take all and give nothing
take every freed mans rite
damaged and desecrated
corrupted and controlled
conformed to one mans vision
we are now condemned to fight

ill never forget the first time i saw zero tolerance or the day i got a dubbed victim in pain cassette with dont forget the struggle on the other side not to much has changed in me since then maybe its me thats stuck but thats fine with me

i cant forget this struggle
you cant take this away from me
from the ashes i found true strength
built conviction to crush whats week
strength of the mind
forced to see the other side
with belief in self
through this world i reject
whether you like it or not this is where i belong
this struggle is now mine
hardships defined
whats your lose or gain
keep your focus keep your faith
men of steel rust
idols show true face
let them wash away
i remain
like it or not this is where i belong
from the ashes i found true strength
built conviction to crush whats week

im in too deep
climbing up and down these walls
my heart is lost
though i never thought id give it up

now im back in the darkness
of the waiting room for ones to be
i sacrifice your body and my soul
so that hell be coming back for you
so that hell be coming back for you

cause when you feel all the darkness surround you
youre selling your soul to the shadowman
in pain you are begging your master to guide you
back to the dark though you dont know why
and now you realize that your soul is no longer alive
and than you feel that you are dead inside

the stars align
in a formation never seen before
a premonition a prophecy
and the shadow has returned to life

i hope you wont remember
who you were and how you used to be
you gave it up cause you couldnt take the pain
of always looking through a strangers eyes

all the stars alight
in the newborn night
they are falling from the sky
and the colors here around me is fading to gray

now i can feel that the powers surround me
caught in the spell of the shadowman
the spirits awake and they gather to hide you
cause this is the end and i dont know why
what in the world can i have done to deserve the pain
that is burning inside me as i close my eyes

the light of the day has awakened to open up my eyes
where are you now did he take you away
the spirits arise and they tell me that they will show the way
they will lead me to a sanctuary
if you were there it would really ease the pain
aaaah  he will return tonight

lead dstndstn

now youre on the outside looking in
waiting for the battle to begin
waiting for the shadowman to take a part of me
wonder why he couldnt end it all
when he had the chance to make me fall
could it be the love inside of you

now i can see that the darkness surround me
the night is in league with the shadowman
all of the spirits are gathered beside you
guarding your soul in the candlelight
if we are strong and fill our hearts with love well survive
the joy and the laughter will defend your life

all that i see can conceive
your wanton indifference derides
decisions werent hard to deceive
how we fooled ourselves when it died

searching for a new place to hide
afar from your vile naive complacency
burning scathing
in nausea confide

mocked in sudden ecstasy

in the earth as in fire
fundamental laws i repel
the fool i was allured by desire
corroded and hollow you feel

that a person would forsake herself and try to break herself with pain
just like a child youre so innocent and you long so much to feel
but instead you push the needle deeper down your vein
sad so see you sad to see your sorrow
you know ive seen you in so many different ways
the reflections of your agony are scarred upon your face
you warm the spoon just to numb yourself from much much better days
and you hope that someone else is there who might want to take your place
every time you scream i hear you though you scream so silent
and youre longing for your baby child to be in a much better place
so addicted to your loneliness full of self destructive violence
you still try to love your child and see the smile upon its face

take away the pain you could be dead tomorrow
i wish that i could help you but theres nothing i can do
i wish that i could help you but theres nothing i can do
i feel as if im by your side even though youre far away from here
the poison mingles with your blood and slowly satisfies you
but what i wonder most of all is if you really want to disappear
you keep struggling with emotions mixed inside you
please dont disappear you know too many people love you
but you see youre still the only one that can ever dry your tears
so dont rely on anyone below or up above you
you better grab your life and then get a grip before it disappears

with all your hopes and all your fears theres so much

she always let her beauty shine

i could lose myself in her eyes and the wind in her
hair

more beautiful than ive ever seen
and whispers words of love and hope into my ear
i dont want her to go away
she tells me she would like to stay
as i see her wipe away a lonely tear

time cannot take away her grace
i can still see her face

when she and i unite

as the void in mans heart grows wide
empty human grabs at the air around
as fashions drift along through life
chasing the wind
the emptiness will never be satisfied
while pleasure warms the dullness inside
restoration groans for fulfillment
within the captivity of pride
chorus
overseer creation testifies
as pride of man holds
back the helpless cries
drawing near with arms
stretched open wide
inviting forgiveness in its place
inside
instinct persuades the will
men like animals respond
to the calling of desire
ignorant of the creator
may god subject them all
our to labour on their own
when human strength fails
then theyll call upon the lord
yet in gods great compassion
he floods his grace upon our soul
mankind chooses helplessness
as pride holds back the cries
and outwardly denies it
as he closes up inside
chorus
i cry out to the lord in my distress
he takes away the chains
that bind my soul
let us give thank for his
unfailing word
for he sets us free

do you mean to challenge me
cause your speech is threatening
to the writer of your history
through a future perverted by envy

your whisper may sway the weak
but when i speak it roars the sea
your challenge has been met
cause with a breath i could snap your neck

this wont be like the first time you tried
cause my patience and mercy for you has run dry
youve watered among my bride
and started seeds to feed your throning flight

i will sing to the world your storm is capturing
and the angles will join me
we will sing to a world reborn from suffering
but mark my words

cause if that tree keeps them from seeing me
i will burn off your limbs you will never shade again

you will bow at my feet or ill rip out your knees
and make of your face all the carnage you crave
i am the finisher and i am forever

i will sing to the world your storm is capturing
and the angels will join me
we will sing to a world reborn from suffering

from the armories the angels sing
you will see them end this suffering
from the armories the angels sing
you will fear them when they lift their wings

they will sing to a world reborn
they will sing as i cut off your horns
ill cut off your horns

will never find us
this failed fate this failed fate
my failed fate

i can feel her hand in the clockwork of my design
waiting for the hourglass to empty and choke on the
sands of time
i watched hope slip through my fingers knowing it would
never be mine

tonights the night all hope turns to dust
tonights the night love fails to lust
another cycle theres no mending my shattered heart

another cycle youre just there to play the fucking
part

heartless

youre just second rate and this is a half hearted
suicide
it hurts me know but in time ill learn to forget
everything about you
i want to drag your face through pins and needles just
to see if you lie as sweet when youre black and blue

now lie awake at night and remember all those things
you thought youd never feel
and when we leave this all behind us this failed fate
will never find us

this is where it starts and this is where it will end
with her open mouth and bloodstained cheeks and death
starring in

they all fuck the same i cant say it enough x

fathers eyes staring in the blackness of the morning
mother cries echoing the shadows of the sunrise
there you stood arms cloaked in darkness where the shades have gone
wave goodbye to all that you know and all youll ever be

where will i run the faces are so cold
how will i rule with arms against the sky
where will i go when all has been disowned
lord of this world leave my soul alone

troy is burning say farewell hail
light the fire of a thousand days war
pain and slaughter even gods can lie
when the legends die cry like rain

steal the wind gather all the evenings suns so blind
wheres your soul forged in the mist of dawn in time will rise
to damn the gods this is no illusion there are ways to bear my share
to kill them all blacker than a thousand vows when water rises

how will i run the faces are so cold
how can i stand eyes against the night
where will i go when all is said and done
i leave it behind graces of the world

kill the father kill the son hail
kill each other work is done war
pain is nothing even gods can lie
when the legends die die for me

oh i will not rise again you know
oh i will be torn on bloody ground

how will i race clouds against the sky

would you expect any less from the people at the top
for the beats beats that go with losing any war
taking lives in their hands stringing all the losers up
while the winners write the history books defeated die poor
more bereft of life than an old jackson pollack painting
cold and alone dead and disintegrating
before the hail of bullets there is silence the pow
i can get with this and i can see it all now
its not funny cause when you think youre on the atip you slip
it must be this fucking dark winter weather i torture myself too much anyway
its like when im feeling happy then im jealous of me
you said you didnt like my voice so i kept my jaw steeled
well people say i hold out like a holden caulfield
fat mama cass it was hip automatically
its too much i shook my head spaspaspazmatically

i erase the lines that you mend ive done it before i said ill do it again
i erase the lines that you mend ive done it before i said ill do it again do it again

dont point that thing at me unless you want to use it
bark out abuses to the weakest at the back of the line
its open season on the meek and the useless

but now youre staring out the tv with a smile on your face
squint think and squeeze when you can see me and the whites of my eyes
predicting armageddon all over the place
and were really sorry for all the mistakes we made
but now even if you could eat your own words youd start a hunger strike
its easy to control us if you keep us all afraid
kick sand up in my face like im a wheel guard on your dirt bike
the sicker the quicker thicker the fatter watch em all scatter
but heres the kicker it doesnt matter
ive got my tongue in my cheek so far it makes me mute
heaven is a joke and hell is a lie pay attention son cause these are words to live by
now watch me kick in the teeth of the track like my mind was a steel toe boot

i erase the lines that you mend ive done it before i said ill do it again
i erase the lines that you mend ive done it before i said ill do it again do it again
dont point that thing at me unless you want to use it
bark out abuses to the weakest at the back of the line

its open season on the meek and the useless
squint think and squeeze when you can see me and the whites of my eyes
the undeniable is all about consumption

and anyone around and all the people in the street
the indescribable is up for discussion
theyre pointing fingers and theyre whispering discreetly
who is that man whats he done for his homeland
they all can see him they know where hes going
he knows their hopes will fade without the strength of his hand
he feels so damn obvious that he must be glowing
he is ready for his sneak attack hes gonna go do this shit and not look back
i have the answers for the questions yall been asking me
i will relieve you of the burden of your six figure apathy
i am the dynamite i am the glue
i never underestimate the enemy thats what you do
i never underestimate the enemy thats what you do
i never underestimate the enemy thats what you do

dont point that thing at me unless you want to use it

its open season cause its good good good
dont point that thing at me unless you want to use it

and ill borrow the famous last words the poisoned nightingales final verse the stolen glass shards that remind us of the part when we were growing up not growing old
a cut that ceases to heal a headache the no longer feels a tear that drips slow a boy without a home strangers wearing kind stripes of gold

so let the rain fall slow this delicate silence has finally found a home while the rave of the night follows morning
the lights they sing why dont you find all your troubles and put them to sleep with a kiss goodbye goodnight

but i have tried too hard to fight for our love and then watch it fall apart
in front of my eyes youll see
if you want it like i do then pray here with me
just look to the stars and never forget how our stories untold were just stories unsaid
so lets sing to the sky raise up our glass while our times were well spent our times were too fast
so just grasp my hand throw it away drop all of our promises and float into space
but i promise you i promise you that i will fight until the end

feeling deathdamp and pain in the liver
i saw a nightmare through my fairy dream
and it washed me just like an icecold stream
once i was told by a fortuneteller
you were the last man standing in valor
scars on the soul are never too old
they dont age with time  they only grow
blood cannot warm up scars on the soul
scars cause me pain for theyre never too old
years bring us one scar after other
friends pass away children lose their mothers
pain within me is becoming stunning
i guess my time to fade out is coming
i want to take things under my control
instead the scar is still gnawing my soul
i stay up all night and go through this ache
im so scared to die before im awake

firmly held by the strongest chains

forever and ever till the end of time

a ticket is clutched in your hand
wearing a vest made of denim
with patches of your favorite bands

up from the pit
we launch an assault on the stage
hatchets are buried in craniums
in a frenzy of psychotic rage
killing machines

drained of all emotion body now an empty shell

a figure clothed in hatred i pray that this cannot be
faced by this total stranger aware of your creation
no vision of the former self
controlled by your instruction

onward you advance left in a mindless trance

descent to darkness life forever left
imprisoned awaiting the second death
incarcerate in a solid rock cell

rejected god intentionally unaware

assembled to inflict verbal torment
reminded of salvation seeds forever dormant

realization of eternity bleeds into cries
sneering and chanting manifesting on the walls

convicted now but too late to believe
laid out for all his perfect will

father time goes wandering around with alzheimers head
while she lay in bed strung out and bleeding
which came first
love or hate want or need you can tell a lot about a man by the way he bleeds
still theyre asking questions prying eyes spying and sneering
father time came wandering by started to pry got clocked in the eye
and cried all the fucking way home
its hard to believe and breathe locked in a trunk at  degrees

 soulless lifes
share  common disease
 humid nights in the cypress trees

without reason without rhyme bit the hand that fed him
and he said his goodbyes
concealed issues concealing lies
a tragedy brewing in his disguise
changing issues changing lies his victims are becoming easier to find
now i see love and hate want
and need its all the same just a matter of degree
have you seen the lonely one with the gun
ive seen him here hoping and waiting
still theyre asking questions prying eyes spying and sneering
spying and sneering
hes walking around with daggers for eyes
and a hole in his soul to swallow you through

the evening airs intoxicating were on top of the world

well cut from this knife and well bleed out our insides
your eyes gut me like the sharpest of knives

lyrics o alexander

my time has come to enter beyond
the realm of the lifeless
dawn of grey take my soul away

like autumn leaves that fall from trees
and voices of a winter breeze
these voices calling unto me
to enter the eternal drift

for i must depart this tragidy my life
i must end this misery   forever

tears of agony
fall from above
i gaze into the stars
is she in the heavens

mother earth give birth to death
love is the seed of life
hate is the tree of death
it is now this tree stands tall

i kneel beside her grave
and cry for her return
roses fall to the ground
but her soul still remains

we shall unite in eternity
nothing can keep us apart
blood pours of thy flesh
for you i take my own life

i watch myself bleed
a lake of sadness becomes dry
as i descend into thy grave  

tears of agony
fall from above
i gaze into the stars
is she in the heavens

i visit her lonely grave
lust for her i crave
once so beautiful
now shes rotted flesh

the media is a tool designed to mold us into slaves
drugging us into an empty apathetic daze
the trick is that we think that everything is going fine
but the truth to our reality lies buried in the mind

i dont give a fuck about the hollywood elite
i dont really care if models cant fucking eat
i dont give a fuck a fuck about which movie is on top
but what i really know is that the shit has got to stop

consumer appetites are never satisfied in full
ause the objects that they buy can simply never fill the void
a constant need for meaning and accumulating shit
drives the lust in their obsession just to get another fix

i dont give a fuck about the tv ratings game
the real world is not a party just a place for the insane
if that reflects reality then pass another drink
you try to be a millionaire ill vomit in the sink

what the fuck is left to try
on an avaricious nation on an economic high
if rome could last  years
who then will throw the wrench inside our gears

the bottom line is money on the western power scene
where celebrities and porn can let the population dream
theyre pathetic human living in an advertising glut
who devour with a passion what the mainstream vomits up

im a little insane im a little deranged

now youre back in the game
cant keep up the pace
this race was mine from the start
fuck life in the cage break all the chains
the fuel i need and i shall rise above

blood in blood out
dont you ever fuckin let me down

lie for the money die for the money
cry cause youre all underpaid
lie for the pussy and die by the pussy
cry in a world of pain
and you that fuckin fashion queen
fuck the fashion fuck the city and that dream

the stygian battery is primed to extinguish
artillery contrived through the pulse of the spirits
claimed within the umbral webs
the coffin shells creep slowly across the battlefields
bearing the noxious ammunition of incorporeal dead

chorus
the art of virulent ballistics  the unseen hunger of dread phantoms
eternal nightmares of the unfulfilled now fired in salvos as one
repurposed for siege and extinction  apparitions in untold supplies
they echo the death of centuries as they disperse and bring your demise

we harvest the wretched wastes of infinite despair
the endless winds of the gray dismal fields
the eidolons that wander in blind quivering masses
ensnared in recruitment to fuel the munitions we wield

defenders of the ancient world at war
and if were gonna die keep that spark
defenders of the ancient life we are yes we are

hunters came the night before
they brought to our homes their war bloody war
all the others just like me
have to face the enemy its gotta be

they have all been innocent of starting all this waste
but the demons ran a deadly race
we were made to force them down and end their killing aims
to save the creators precious lifes

defenders of the ancient life we are
defenders of the ancient world at war
and if were gonna die keep that spark
defenders of the ancient life we are yes we are

noone ever gave us names
we were forged in fire and flames red hot flames
crafted to protect the ones
chasing every unknown sound thats around

we were made to force them down and end their deadly games
to save the creators precious lifes
they have all been innocent of starting all this waste
but the demons had their killing aims

beyond the night deep in the darkness
im waitinghidden from the light
to show you foreign lands of horror
to be your guide into the night

i show you realms youve never heard of
where mountains meet a bloody sky
where fallen angels gorge the corpse
where shadows grow

a world belonging to sleep
to dreams and their inhabitants
a world abysmal cruel and evil
full of your curses descendants

this world and also whats beyond
arises from your imagination
but the forces that you dread
wont come without an invocation

consider well what you desire
maybe your wishes become true
and anything you once imagined
youll meet again and again

in the world belonging to sleep

a world abysmal cruel and evil
full of your curses descendants

there is an endless stairway down
to the dungeon of your mind
and you should walk quite cautiously
if you dont know what you will find

there are borders which you shouldnt cross
unless you know youre strong enough
on your journey into the void
when you have passed the gates of dusk

i pace alone
in a place for the dead
overcome by woe
and here ive grown
so fond of dread
that i swear its heaven

oh sweet mary
dressed in gray
roll back the stone

with these words scrawled in a severed hand
tears fall like shards of glass that bend
in rivers like sinners
swept with me to join the damned

a darkened sky
the day that laughter died
fell swiftly into night
and stayed within her sight
staring at the knife
oh god how easy now to sacrifice
my life to have her with me

so farewell to distant thunder
those inept stars ive worshipped under
fall farther their father
lies in wait in flames below
whilst my love a blood red flower
calls to me from verdant bowers

graveside i cry
please save me from this hell i know

a darkened sky
the day that laughter died
fell swiftly into night
and stayed within her sight
staring at the knife
oh god how easy now to sacrifice
my life to have her with me

an eye for an eye as espied in the bible
my faith is lost to the burning of idols
one less cross to press upon the survival
of this lorded agony

and i much as i have tried
to bury her from mind
fates tourniquet was tied when she died
still sense her presence so divine
lithe arms about my throat
like pining swans entwined
footfalls at nightfall close to mine

suicide is a tried and tested formula for release

i snatch her whisper like the wind through cedars
see her face in every natural feature
midst the mist and sleepy hollows of fever
with glee deceiving me

suicide is a tried and tested formula for release

i hear her voice from where the grave defies her
siren song to sing along no finer
suicide notes harmonized in a minor
strike a chord with misery

no light nor reef
no unsinkable of romance keeps me
safely from the stormy seas
now drowning resounding
deathknells pound my dreams
unthinkable to dredge through this
listless and lonely winter freeze

a darkened sky
this day hereafter dies
falls swiftly into night
and stays within my sight
staring at the knife
oh god what ease it was to sacrifice
my life to have her with me

no more a victim of crusade
where souls are strung from moral palisades
i slit my wrist and quickly slip away
i journey now on jeweled sands
beneath a moon to summer lands
to grace her lips with contraband
the blaze once in my veins

when inherently it has such nutritional uses

gutted entrails brewing choice cuts
ruptured pustules spewing
immature giblet pudding choice cuts
infanticidal cooking

im the ghoul of the culinary profession
preparing this toddler for a meal
served up with ghastly garnishes
a lividinous glaze congeals
making use of my recipe selection
a myriad of ways to do the infant
each dish stirring up my appetite
to engage in abortive devourement

cleavers and whisks my tools of dissection
a gas powered stove my crematory
the fridge acts as the juveniles morgue
in a kitchen so bloody and gory

the body carbonizes in my oven
the stuffing held in by sutures
ingredients from an embrionic sac
the act of an obstetrical butcher
repeatedly basted in menstruation
endometrium set aside for a toast
the once smoothe skin now crackles and burns
this will surely stunt its growth

graven goulash make it posh

solo the other white meat by as labarre

prone on the dining room table
the babe is subjected to my fork
as i consume the first helpings
i delight in my toil and work
i clean my plate of all its dressings
grazing on all the putrid gore
merely whetting my taste buds
i am disposed to fix up some more

candlelight flickers off my best china
the silvers been polished to a gleam
despite masticating postmartem abortions
im more civilized than it may seem

light in the shadows has words to say

black shadows life behind the veil
who dares to change the life someday

i search to find a kind of truth about you
only finding you using self indulgence as a tool

its me i hate not you at all
i am my own medicine
turned into a poison

i think i gave you a lot
and not enough i know
tortured myself same as you
without losing my sanity
wheres my applause

i see no reason to live in hell
how can life make me feel so incomplete

i had a weakness and my walls came down
my tears wont reach the ground
burn my new wound

i know i cannot feel regret for anything
if i was numb id end this once and for all
i feel the burn still

i cannot face this day my guards are down
i cannot love myself weak sad clown

i see myself my fading colour
i see no hope there where i always used to

i fear your words the things they mirror
maybe that is all i am just a reflection please help me

i see no reason to live in hell
when you smile you make me feel incomplete

but its all ending the clocks rewinding
we dont mean anything to me you think
i killed this silence for us to make things right
the words are loaded

once connected
one torso one head
one solid reason the pain
if loves the neck kept us together and apart
now its broken

there is no cast no real salvation
when it is broken it will stay that way
believe me when i say this
i would not if i did not care

tears dont mean anything
if we dont know when were sorry
no one will win today we cant play this game this way

we cannot soar and still stay on the ground
dont wanna see me hear me hate me

hate hate hate

jealousys a phantom
something that was never ever meant to find me
but now its pale green eyes have destroyed everything

you know how it must hurt and i know
there is nothing youve done to deserve this

apologys a policy
sometimes it really has to be its kept me afloat thus far

this sure nufs one nice
loose noose perfect times
are we happy in this hell
is there someone who can measure
whose pain is bigger

it all has ended the clocks rewinded
we dont mean anything to me you think
i killed this silence for you to end the night
the words are loaded

unprotected one torso no head
one valid reason the lifes suspended
if loves the neck that kept us together and apart
now its broken

theres no cast no real solution
when it is broken it will stay that way
believe me when i say this
i would not if i did not care

who needs who when and what the hell for
who wants to suffer and be hardcore
and whos strong enough to peel off the dead skin

 october 
such grim musings as have been occupying my mind of late unfortunately seem
to suggest a possible link to the fate of my learned friend and colleague
doctor ignatius stone that brilliant researcher was last seen in command
of all his faculties whilst on an expedition to the ruins of the sumerian
city of ur an undertaking which preceded my own work there by some eighteen
months stone was a gifted archaeologist who also dabbled perhaps unwisely
in certain areas of the occult particularly involving the various
grotesqueries once worshipped as cthonic deities by the ancient denizens of ur
mere days before he ventured into the ziggurats of that foreboding
mysteryhaunted site he had dispatched a letter to me claiming that he was
on the verge of a truly staggering arcane discovery at ur which would
simultaneously prove the cyclical nature of human civilisation as well as
immediately render redundant all previous theories on the origin of man
whatever misfortune befell him within those aeonsold tombs robbed him
irrevocably of his sanity for when his attendants finally managed to prise
open the stone door of the vast central catacomb which had im told
inexplicably shut fast behind his threeman torchbearing party they found
two of the regularly stalwart men had seemingly expired of pure fright
while stone was slumped against the north wall staring vacantly into the
gloom gibbering about visitations by beings so terrible that the very
contemplation of their existence would sunder a mans tenuous hold on the
reins of sanity
when i later visited him at the sanatorium in england i found him to be a
tragic shell of the man i once knew a man beset by imagined terrors and
ever wary of the immemorial horrors which he claimed lurked at the periphery
of humanitys perceptions indeed i was glad i had taken a journal into
which i could transcribe his delusional rants for he had a great deal to
tell me about the dreamer in the catacombs of ur

dear slim
my favorite icon put the bong and the knife down
im sick of the songs about strapping your mom and your exwife down
to a nuclear bomb and dropping them on saddam
killing all the muses you use in almost all of your songs
except those songs about slim the hiphoppian god
they make it seem you dont respect rappers like biggie and pac
who if it werent for them you be out of a job
or flipping burgers with ronald mcdonald and not leading your mob
but the blobs offensive run and jumping the fences
and burying politicians in pop culture trenches
dude have some humility oops responsibility oops accountability oops i said humility
your face has covered worse magazines
than the artists and politicians youve mocked on every cd release
ooh how cool youve proved you lack tact in your songs
in fact youve grown up to act just like your mom

if yall represent the truth and americas youth
act like a leader we could actually use
youre a celebrity now oh no look what you did
youre americas role model but deny that youre it

come on come on lets stand together as one

i aint yelling about selling my soul going to hell and back for platinum
or gold to show the world is a gullible globe
although i cant respect the coalition of politicians signing petitions
fearing eminems mission to bitch
when its his right to taunt if he wants to fight
even if youre frightened of what he might want to write
youre sworn to defend men who offend men
just because you believe in the first amendment
even if its illogical angst and vengeance
so defend your senses but cleanse your dirty lenses
the laws written to both conservatives and leftists
it says vanilla ice preservatives can be sexist

if yall represent the truth and americas youth
act like the leaders we could actually use
youre politicians now oh no look what you did
youre americas role models but deny art from our kids

come on come on lets stand together as one

censoring the denial of actual words or factual things declared obscene
but molesting archdiocese disease
dead people in the streets from shooting sprees epidemics
paramedics clearing debris here and overseas arent banned from tv
but yell shit goddamn or fuck hear three individual bleeps
a words a word let it be heard and learned
its not the individual words but the order that hurts
come on come on lets stand together as one
come on come on stop threatening to censor our thoughts
and youll get the response you want from now on

echoes of mesopotamia
a whispered disease that left us on knees too weak to stand
upon this empire natures purity revealed
wave the sword of science keep the truth concealed
we are the ten thousand year reich  with us let it end
to the sands of time that lent destruction a hand
let harmful ways amend
for the path has been chosen the damage is done
but our culture continues its course

sip poisoned wine from the chalice of one cultures way
down the highways of progress weve paved
crosses stand erect where death won the day
and we prayed our mortal souls to save

when one does not see what one does not see
one does not even see one is blind

do we choose to close our eyes
or is it the veil is so stained
by the treasons of our humanity
that were helpless of knowing new ways

a tender hush lulls us to sleep
our hope lies shattered like broken glass
march upon hollow dreams
take me back to an unseen past
and cleanse our minds wrecked by time

listen can you hear them
its such comfort knowing they are there
looking over our every move
and guiding us in the right direction
without them what would we be
but lost souls trapped in an untamed jungle
what would we be
but a species undeserving of our proper place
without this civilization
our way of thinking our way of life
what would we be
what kind of lives would we be living
what would we do and where would our paths take us
without the whispered lies of angels

death to the wisdom of the ancients
five hundred generations  now it seems we are forever lost
like priests cloaked in dominions robes
cut up control shape this world in a better way

while we fight to write our names
on the walls of this world going down
what are we fighting for whose world are you fighting for
if ours is the voice that knows only silence
then to whom should we turn for recourse

blessed visionary cut me with your sun
the rivers ran in blood
spark fueled to fire

deep withing the endless void
searching for a sign
the vessel forged inside me
watches over like the death
of the moon
strike the shepherd
sheep will scatter
mountains of despair
i can see the pain
it is written all over your face
the screaming arrows tear through my soul
in the dawn your face is haunting
white ghostly dreams

weight of worlds is on your shoulders
hear the voice of gold
i can see the pain
its written all over your face

desperate heathens flock to sirens
guard your heartache well
momma dont let them take her
take her down

words w sssenbeck  music bhm pichlbauer koritar

thy will be done
as we walk into the war
what you command were dying for
as they all drown
your will arise 
is the truth just idolatry

uh your will be done

as the aeons go by
again to restore the true king
to thy throne
uh all elect ones

we have no names
nor in heaven nor on earth
uh through doors like
snakes we slide
words are unwritten
our number unknown
falling like rain from the sky

uh your kingdom come
as the aeons return
desecrate the holy land
and blind believe
uh your venom flows
like flood we pass
to errect the rightful king

misery suffering blasphemy against your god
warriors deathmachines as he hangs upon the cross
we must destroy
we must install
we must regain
the pontifex 
misery suffering and forever they shall rest
warriors deathmachines a space noone has ever walked
we must restore
we must regain
we must errect
the sacrifice 

you have mouths
but cannot speak
eyes but cannot see
we form the light
but are of darkness
the bright one son of the dawn
your dead shall rise

uh your will be done
as the aeons go by
again to restore the true king
to thy throne
uh all elect ones

dwellers in the dust
awake and sing
your dew is a radiant dew
beneath my feet
hell is prepared
stirred up to greet
and meet you when you come

uh your will be done
as the aeons go by
again to restore the true king
to thy throne
uh all elect ones

misery suffering blasphemy against your god
warriors deathmachines we spit upon the cross
we must erase
from the surface of earth
the damned christian lies
pontifex 
misery suffering with hatred in our hearts
warriors deathmachines a raging storm of blasphemy
we must restore
we must regain
we must erect

shake your fist at the sky did your god up and die did your hero

back and shout there are no rules what gives you the right to stand up and
fight there is only one rule though it may sound cruel there are no rules
the wages of sin have the highest wage take a trip through hell cause the
demons to rage there are no rules every generation bears a soldier of the
truth who marches through the realm setting fire to every roof yelling
there are no rules and as the flames leap high into the stormy night he
leaps onto a log and laughs at the masses burning bright yelling there are
no rules feel the flame in my voice
do you have any choice but to
reach out for the sky grab the sun you may no die there are no rules let

are we meant to live alone
inside a torn and broken home
no one to hate besides yourself
true human nature
lights are fading
the whisper of a voice
so low

the silence will haunt you

chorus
with flames all the pain we erase
from ashes a new dawn awakes
in blood red shades
humanity is made
together we choose our own fate

postchorus
let the roses fall
stand aligned
let them fall
alone

piercing sounds fill the cold
sending shivers through our souls
inside the dark we shall awake
again
lives are fading
the echoes of their screams unfold

the silence will haunt you
again

replacing the blood with virus and insects

suffering upon the cross of surgery

chunks of your own flesh are forced into your mouth

trying to conceal his murders
the maniac stabs the heart stops the flow
cleaning up the bloods a problem
he now solves hooks through heels
hung and bled

corpses are suspended by their feet
swaying dripping bloody piece of meat
fastened to the ceiling leaking gore
splashing down to the floor

corpses he suspended turning pale
all the blood drained into his grail
fastened to the ceiling dry and dead
fluids of life have been shed
hung and bled

congealing fluids fester the stench
revolting septic gruel
putrid slop licks the surface of his dungeon
a gruesome meal rancid feast live on death

corpses dangle lifeless gray and cold
rotting flesh the meat hooks lose their hold
stenching body falls onto the ground
bones and flesh form a mound

sanguinary killer will not stop
hanging dead replacing those that drop
blood he drinks like wine their flesh his bread
in his maw dripping red
hung and bled

oozing blood the butchers victims
soak the concrete putrefy
halls of dread draped with death
ornate crimes stalactites made of flesh
festooned with innards

gaining life sentient place
the stone walls breathe
hungry soul it can think
a genuine living hell

created by the butcher he lost control
owner and property change their roles
constantly feeding the gluttonous room
he once ruled the chamber now its his tomb

hung by their feet drained of blood
swallowed by death greed of this place
bodies decay devoured by evil

lyrics mendoza

a predator awaits
his time to be discovered
just waiting for a prey
the index case
he will spread the death
through all the race
the horseman of the plague
now it s useless
to pray   

andromeda strain you will die soon
loosing blood through every hole
melena myalgia and fever
ebolalike disease

now you have the touch of death
deterioration by sweating blood
repulsive body in
agony   

the prophecy was true
eradication of our kind
alone we walk the path
many of us will die
only the chosen may survive this time   
of chaos and death

your face becomes a mask
of expressionless white skin
from where the sunken eyeballs
cry bloody tears that fall
screams from all around
everywhere the bloody eyes
that stare with the horror
only death can paint
in the eyes   

chorus

the prophecy was true

solo tono

struggling to breath
walking through streets
where convulsing bodies
just fall and die
before your eyes
the vision of the slaughter
of a heartless killer

you see a pregnant women
with a fetal loss
and genital bleeding
theres nothing you can do
but pray for her
she died in a state of shock
and the pain of her lost

solo ndua

your time has come
nausea  vomiting bleeding myalgia fever
anuria melena delirium tachypnea convulsions
coma stertor death

chorus
has ended with our kind 

theres no disease
that can kill us all
a few just may survive
theres hope an other chance

lead ndua
but for now the silence reigns
many corpses in the slaughter field
with their static bloody eyes
just wondering why
the smell of rotting flesh
floats with the wind
that also caries the disease

a meadow i see
the sky is grey
far away to the north
dark fingers strike the stars
a tree stands proud and tall
the desert is its fellow
alone it watches the land
it guards the waste of cold sand
this lonely form of life
is only an illusion
it hides a dark reality
it covers a great temple
i float before the gate
i read the known inscriptions
i say the words of power
i enter through the passage
long stairs descend the abyss
they fall in the deeps of this cold land
where the lord of dreams sleeps in death
dreaming its revenge

generations came and went

here comes the biggest asshole
that the whole world has ever seen
watch as things turn to something
i never meant to be
call it a side effect of my arrested development
here with you im trapped out of my element
i tear through all this wreckage
you left when you dropped the bomb
is there something worth saving
or do i act like nothings wrong
the lesser of two equals gives me nothing at all
lust and madness murder and mayhem
my whole lifes been about playing
its so surreal
maybe thats why i touch but cant feel
sittin pretty as i sit up straight
trying to find means to an end
i move into harms way
i see my face in the mirror
i feel my feet but i cant seem to walk in my shoes
when it hurts i feel closer to you
closer than you ever knew
and the bottom line is knowing
i will die and the worms will eat me
the bottom line is knowing
aint no one else i can be

the days when ancient blood
will awake in the hearts of white men and women
our banners will rise to the sky
and will flap with joy on wind
ancient widsom and strength will return
divided nation will become unity
and cry of thousands of throats
will disperse darkness
clearing a way for swarozyc light
the gates to source of our might
on rushing shining chariots
heroes of nation will return us our pride

fire will be brought to life
and will light forever
in its warm and lights of flames
new generations will be bred
when ancient blood will return us our will
we will not be afraid of darkness any more
and swarozyc light will disperse the darkness of night
in bloody struggle fighting bravely
through courage and bravery
looking into deaths eyes
we will join proud heroes
who with might and main gave their lives away
and belong to the past fighting
for honor and pride of our race
when blood of ours and of our enemies
with falsehood and lies put to sleep
will awake from a long sleep

in darkness of night swords will shine
and squeal of coming death
will bring fear to the enemy
in flames of victory and glory
words full of honor and pride
will be brought back to light
in deadly struggle spilling our blood
we will raise banners of victory
signs of triumph and rebirth
in flames of swarozyc light
on our defiled soil
when ancient blood
will awake in us

invisible but yet so clear
reflections seen by a fugitive
trying to escape the looking glass
blood runs from open wounds of false flesh
the one in front of the mirror exceeds the image
eager to leave further but chained still

to crumble into such nothingness
a despairing fate for your lies
to pretend is the lunatics legacy
privileged to bolt the nails of heresy

born lifeless into a world of coma
as the chronic sufferer trapped in paradise lost
missing insinuations of what life was meant to be
angels and demons a march mans bewildering hosts

chorus
the charlatans and deceivers walk the line in prejudice
the narrow slits the veins in search for the crown
profound impatience makes the blind struggle in stupidity
the paradox of the daily prayer diffidence is confiteor
phenomena of ironies cast the litany aside
how intelligible blessed be the forgetful

holding the banner high unrestrained
slowly abandoning the surface in contempt
still in costumes to please the ways of living
witnessing the details of defilement intoxicating

make sure to be pleased with the ways of your death
for in days of reckoning and when the twilight torn is ticking
elysium is halfway and as an answer to the plea
youre destined to yield fragments of hell in return

leave unnoticed with the perfect conscience
with the strength of the spiritual eye
spirits of the token unchained and free
recover from the philanthropic macabre frenzy

demon to some angel to others

this heaven you call my life
dont test my patience
just to give it one more chance
to believe that destiny could change
to believe that i can tame this rage
im lost inside this world
im lost inside myself

no more resistance no more truthful essence
no more substance no more meaningful lessons

dont try to justify the life you crucified
all the lies are written in the skies
im immortal but ready to die

watch the angels fall they drop tears of blood
i think my life is fading away yes im swept away

serenity in fire

my heart one with the dark my soul trapped and gridlocked

serenity in fire

spread your wings as i strike them down
ill strike them down

im lost inside this world im lost inside myself
no one can change this world you made hell

no more resistance
no more truthful essence
no more substance
no more meaningful lessons

dont try to justify the life you crucified
all the lies are written in the skies
im immortal but ready to die

ill strike you down

inside these chilling walls she must call home
she shivers in repeating desperation
and there her biggest fear beacons her to come
the box of her reluctant adoration

it plays the sound of angels
it breaks her mind to pieces
she has no choice but to accept what it gives and takes

it waits what does it hold
it calls what will the box provide
khomorrahs aching spirit
enslaved to find out whats inside

the fear of the unknown draws the childs tears
intoxicating pain taints the childs mind
pacing the pedestal she must weigh her fears
against the hope of all the good she craves to find

the joy and praise that reigns tonight
can turn to cold and merciless days
of fear and plight

facing her constant nightmare
in fear of
one more in a thousand leaps of faith
for the pain she must once again revere

she must survive the day
she must give in
the childs heart is racing
her nerves come marching in

the box the strain
khomorrahs ball and chain
must open for her hunger to enchain

its done the box of faith has opened once again
but nothing seems to have reciprocated
it cant the box always provides a bearing gift
so from troubles she has not been extricated

but somethings wrong
something tells her she is not alone
from the spherical periphery
of her vision shadows taunt her misery

inside the chilling walls that she must call her mind
the shadows repent the peace she holds
and there her biggest fear tortures her inside
the box that mocks her as her pain unfolds again

feel her strain again
let the shadows reign

whispers a thousand shadows emanate from the box taunting the child and the fear she harbors she had no choice for the box is the only source of nourishment while also being the giver of darkness her mind is about to break she must do something she must stare into the light emanating from the box and face the fear thats haunted her from the inception of her memory

its time to fight to look inside
and stare into the burning ravenous light

and stare into the burning ravenous light

let the light burn all these infernal shadows away
and may blind eyes find these lost shadows of the underworld astray

she stops her movements
and whispers to the trees
secrets of her life
and how its meant to be
clouds look like mountains
she wants to walk on
no wall could be high enough
would always be transcended

dreams are lost in eternity
sense is getting mad
nothing to regret

that is the way she falls in love
she could never be alone
the way she moves
the way she smiles
she could embrace the world
and sprinh grows
out of winter it flows
right into her veins
covers all her pains

dreams are lost in eternity
sense is getting mad
and theres nothing to regret

a befitting doom for a generation

failing to realize its own demise
falling generation caught by surprise

insanity
poseurisms and masochisms
drive the youth to materialism
falling under the corporate wheel
crushed in its wake left with nothing to feel

diverted perceptions and urban decay
millions of people are led astray
not by force but by their own will
no visible enemy no men to kill

our very desires fuel the death machine
were drowned in smoke and by tv screens
made to believe that this is the only way
we follow along until our dying day
emotions thieved from another of their kind
a stolen identity another mans mind
that which is felt is only felt to achieve
the status quo of what is cool to perceive

never take heed
never listen to warning
until its too late
then we start the mourning

embracing emptiness

forsaking the fortress in a quest for the holy grail

who let their dreams decide their fate

ever journeying on through the night

then i find myself lost inside a maze
and i ask is this where ill end my days

straight rains upon my way
a thousand secrets glow
like candles in the glistening snow
they guide me on to higher ground
i spread my wings upon the sound
of childrens laughter lifts my spirits
beyond the realm of restless wraiths
of hungry ghosts who test my faith
who paint their tinselled tombs
by day and night with gilded gloom

sweet mercy takes my hand and
leads me to the promised land where
sweet fortune fills my cup to overflowing

skies of violet
eyes of love reflecting firelight

it is reflected in the schemes that we rune
like the twelvetone system that builds this tune

watching complexity
chaos and order two branches on the creation tree
twins of opposites but balancing the pendulum
like children swinging the seesaw in glee
unknowing about malice destruction and odium

arranged in patterns in a nexus ooze
a complicated network of primary views
micro and macro cosmos flexibility
an ingenious interplay through elemental sophistry

approaching chaos
constantly havoc comes falling down
in the structural circus a morbid clown
still its needed to progress the creation
the reflux of materials comes through devastation

like an untuned singer in the angel choir
a mad prophet that serves the eating fire
its transforming sequence is on repeat
first subverted then complete

but many times they say
mens agitat molem

so we have to figure out our origin
to undress our future

lyrics by thomas karlsson
music by christofer johnsson

eros and thanatos are brances on the same old tree
rooted in the soil of shadow and light
if god was separated from the dark twin the devil
could he ever know the soul of mankind

we want a new god called abraxas

enter the pleroma and see that nothingless is all
and you must destroy a world to be born
alpha and omega are the beginning and the end
united in the shape of abraxas

darkness and the light
sermones ad mortous empty fullness
abraxas your words is a riddle to be solved

you bear the mark of cain
and you are fighting like a bird
to free you from the egg the egg is all the world
the sermon to the dead
a gospel to another life
hear the words of cain the sinner and the saint
the grave is a flower
and you are dying to be born
baptized by fire and you will slough your skin
the sign of abraxas
the circle of the solar year
deep in the winter youll see the sun be born

once a mighty king ruled in a northern land
his enemies he fought with steel and iron hand
so many tales were told his name a glorious sound
godlike he is they said and by no christian laws was bound

long ago in a northern land

one day they came across the nordic sea
the man of the cross and camped beside a tree
which was called a sacred one for all thy heathen hearts
where sacrifices were given to their northern forefathers gods

the elder and wise men amongst them
watched distrustful to all those
of the foreign men with their swords in hand
and the mighty tree was felled

some days gone by and the elder men disappointed
they found a grave with a wooden cross upon
so they all gathered at a place near the sea at night
they all sat around their king and a campfire gave its light

first words were spoken by a maiden of great beauty
she whispered silent words to freya and began to speak
her iceblue eyes filled with tears as she told them all what happened
in the woods three days ago when two christian men raped her body

many people told what happened and what was done by the christian men
a girl was burned and three farmers died nine children were never seen again

the king drew his sword and saddled his black horse
they gave a sacrifice to odin and to tyr the gods of their war
that might before the morning of revenge

the stars were shining from a dark black sky
their swords reflected the light of the moon
their torches burned red the flames blazed up high
the hour of their raid will come soon revenge

as the sun at last arose crimson beyond the nordic sea
they all stood in armour with helmet and sword
and with certainty of what was forever will be

a furore normannorum libera nos domine

the bells of the christian churches tolled
woke them up so much to late
two ravens high above watched this bloody deeds
when the steel becomes their fate

after hours the most of the christian men
by the northmen all were slayed
the sun high above was shining bright
that day of heathenpride

rancour fed i grasp her head
hurl her ass against the wall
merry thoughts i disenthrall
taking my nails to devour her entrails

with excremental lubricant i force them down in her cunt
violently piercing her insides  emotions i can no longer hide
feel the steel engrain  enjoy the skewering pain
anal crucifixion  hammering
suffer in humility  piercing to the vaginal cavity
sanguinary feces  nailing

she regurgitates the blood  emerging from your sieved guts
oligophrenic debaucheries  mutilations one never sees

affectionate reminiscences  a canvas of carnal decadence
expediting decay defecating matter  sphinctral impalement lancing her bladder
rectal and intestinal suffering  lacerating delights i bring

mutilated in her riddled ass  remnants of what she once was
you dirty slut you get what you deserve
defecating as haematemsia emerge

meathook penetration  rectal defenstration

and leave you like human garbage lyin in drains

ive gotta keep my eyeballs open
the only thing thatll minus the pain like ibuprofen is
milli and k on the case
i dont feel in control like pilots in planes
im trapped in this winding maze
im an insomniac im insane

ive been up for days and nights
through this crazy life
but ill sleep when im dead
until they pay me right
my eyes are open wide
but ill sleep when im dead

when everything on my to do list is ticked off
then maybe i can drift off
until then im wide awake lyin in a daze
my eyeballs gaze

hypnotized by the sound of my wrist watch
clickin tick tock
im in charge of the underground just like brick top
so i cant sleep id be wrong if i did stop

if im focused on writing a verse
you couldnt put me to sleep
with a thousand and nine
bottles of night nurse

its likely ill put ya lights out first
so ill sleep when im restin in peace
until then ive gotta bless these beats
till i conquer the streets
if im conscious i cant get lost in a dream

ive been up for days and nights
through this crazy life
but ill sleep when im dead
until they pay me right
my eyes are open wide
but ill sleep when im dead

if youre drowsy remain in a slumber
my metaphors flow over ya head
like a button less jumper
i cant sleep till im in the sky
like lightning and thunder

sometimes at night i wonder
is pursuein this dream a blunder
or the best thing that i ever did
i cant sleep or slip till im  feet under

hence the song ill sleep when im dead
you might only need money to survive
but my life relies on a needle instead
i wanna eat steak meals everyday

im sick and tired of livin on a diet
of beans and bread
so believe what i said
ill sleep when im where
ill sleep when im what
ill sleep when im dead

ive been up for days and nights
through this crazy life
but ill sleep when im dead
until they pay me right
my eyes are open wide
but ill sleep when im dead

ive been up for days and nights
through this crazy life
but ill sleep when im dead
until they pay me right
my eyes are open wide
but ill sleep when im dead

but when ye had come in one day
we have found our lord was gone
whats done cannot be undone
but we have felt that somethings wrong
because your rope broke under the strain
well take the chain

weve seen the pair of glowing eyes 
with fear we watch as they do shine
make them forsake us like an aim 
make them await
until we fade

cant thou leave our mansions for a while

stop denying your inner self
forced into a religious cell
the agony of fallen grace
at once come forth
deny the facts of life
destroy their gods
and blame it on the weak
several miles of deaths formation
they march towards his grace
to the cliffs and the abyss of the damned
the loss of man and fall of god
and now you will die
while suffering from within
the aspire to rule
will faint away with you
we come for you
with the devils assent
creeping up from behind
tearing you down

far back in time where it all began

forgetting the power that was found

may my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth

dreams you see theyre never too far
dont have others let you think that they are

from what they say and what they suggest
you are one and they would know best

with no ambition to them you would belong

and you see it through
no chains can hold
no chains can hold you down

they would chain and drag you around
pick you up and throw you down
they needle nothing right into your brain
until they see you break down screaming
the trap of life where victims are caught
all dreams erased and thoughts they rot
an empty cavern just working to feed
on hearts and minds that never succeed

and you see it through
no chains can hold
no chains can hold you down

to break from the pack
and they try so hard to stab at your back

you fight
for your sanity

and though some badger and rip at my soul

my power positive will bury them whole

or you could be another welfare case

once under starry heavens
a garden was planted
a wondrous work in the waste wilderness
where lions walked in humility

once the sons of eternal joy reigned upon the earth
and angelic myriad ruled the skies

in his celestial abode the old one slumbered
the one who formed the world into existence

it was a golden age
era of beauty  joy
death was not nor iniquity
the fountain of eternal life sprung

the infernal serpent laid on the verge of nonentity
a doleful shade before the immense gates of infinity

once man walked the heavenly path
in sweet ignorance
enchanted by the unearthly beauty of eden
in ecstatic joy

before the beginning of years
there came to the making of man
time with a gift of tears
grief with a glass that ran

pleasure with pain for leaven
summer with flowers that fell
remembrance fallen from heaven
and madness risen from hell

strength without hands to smite
love that endures for a breath
night the shadow of light
and life the shadow of death

and the high gods took in hand
fire and the falling of tears
and a measure of sliding sand
from under the feet of the years

and froth drift of the sea
and dust of the laboring earth
and bodies of things to be
in the houses of death and of birth

and wrought with weeping and laughter
and fashioned with loathing and love
with life before and after
and death beneath and above

cruel are the eyes of the tyrant
and his heart is abounded to pain
in pleasures of agony and torture
as he begs to bleed in vain
i perish in my own desire
i burn within lusting hate
destructively the winds inspire
the soul to terminate
i ride the ancient overture
as life is torn astray
i glance the illusive spectrum
and all light that fades away
black energies in the twilight space
comes shivering through the shallow haze
into darkness so impure divine
a bloodshed emotion to evil wine
darkzone martyrium endless vast mysterium
give to me the blessing when i meet my destiny
ruin is all there is to feel
and the cold reality if steel
life slips through your fingers

sleep deprivation theme

sleep and then you will see
as you even cant imagine yourself
as sometimes all of the things
overturn upsidedown

oh my dearest
they seem to be real
and all of them 
i mean those people are sheep who do not differ from one an another

sleep and then you will see
have a look at your dreams 
they are burning in flames
like the rags torn asunder

and under you feet
cant you see dying days
you cannot leave
your sweet sleepering chamber

nobody minds
thats only a dream
its high time to go ahead to bed
nothing yet
almost done
twofaced devils child

rise and cry
nobody won
anyone
and lost this one either
having arrived from the other side
forlorn in silent pride

mist and disease do exist in your dreams
strange flames are waltzing so beautiful now

under your feet
and on your way home
there is no need to cure
they are your sick overture
before you go insane at all
autumn flames stole your dreams
dancing flames stole your soul
nobody minds if you fall asleep

sleep if you can
sleep if you will
sleep if you see the bright light next to me
sleep if you dare to watch my surprise
sleep cause i dont care
havent you heard my nice lullabies

the wooden ladle theme

some people only need in food and want to muck
some of them got to live in fight and have bad luck
some of them born with a silver spoon in a mouth
and the others with a wooden ladle
youll have seen as

shall we be fighting with the sin
has spread abyss as endless sea
you mean us it wont touch me
even if i follow all these fools

some people have got to drown and die
in seas or in a glass of wine
and if you share their way 
you will have got the most of attributes

dominion do we need not quite

oh you had better listen to the rustle of the silent days
watch as poor mankind does make a million ways 
during its countless nights and days
caught in a trap full of deadly haze 
it always does search for itself
betray

dont give them another chance anymore
let them disappoint themselves more and more
let them drown in bloody sea and stay on the shore 
they yet wanted all the cares and got them all

what have you got in a mouth  in a mouth of yours
who knows of this delicious one tell me  i cant suppose
let me look at this one in a mouth of yours
perhaps it sounds great and looks so fun i suppose

you cannot stay outside the death
first one thats looking very sad
dont try to be a god
therefore you cannot be a god
poor mortal whore

you will have known it very soon
who gets a ladle or a spoon
why did you get your wooden one
and who had thrown it into your mouth

nobody did believe this
thou art not a god
the thoughts of thine with thy wrath are falling apart
because of idiotic ae thou dost keep in thy mouth
with ladle thou wert made
thou shalt not become the devilkin before it is too late
thy wooden ae doth make thee weep
it doth not want thee to eat or sleep 
it doth make thy path pass away
thou art getting paler day by day
try to appease thy angry daemon and keep him in thy mouth
feed him by thy flesh and thy bones far more than usual
thou art poor mortal whore

there is wonderful place  there is beautiful place
keep your temper  you are not to be in a maze
there is haze of oblivion  wonderful haze
there is wonderful place for your future remains

sleep deprivation theme

sleep fast and do not be afraid
when you will have awoke
youll be rich and mighty as before
mad sea alike thou winna know
of thine shore poor mortal whore

sleep and then you will see
dark and bottomless sea
sleep and then you will buy
hidden essence of thine

come along side by side
next to your filthy pride
evil demons of time
will have not passed thee by

wonder i if youd mind
dying now in a sleep
you are poor mortal whore
youre degenerate sheep

sleep and then you wont see
as the hollow  eyed darkness comes
sleep and then you wont see
as the blind moon is arising

sleep and then you wont see
all of the sudden cares
you even do fear
to think of them again and again

sleep and then you wont see
sleeping grim entity
if the nightmares of yours
not suffocate you before
you are poor mortal whore

you wont wait for salvation
whilst you have your nightmares
and sleep deprivation
sleep and then you will see
two faces of god

prisoners of the venom master
guilty for what youve been charged
sit in cells condemned to face
the deadly snap of their jaws

terror stricken you lie and wait
in the final hour
knowing of your wretched fate
and the serent power

first strike is deadly

the evil path that you must take
is filled with the slither of snakes
their hiding and waiting for the time to lunge
for your flesh and your fate

no one escapes or comes out alive
for the snakes theyll never lose
for if they hit you just one time
you have just faced your doom

first strike is deadly

deadly strike bred to kill
the venoms howling in your veins
psychotic spell a gift from hell
the sound of a deadly lead remains

in a world of despair our lives will end
some without warning while others die by design
under watchful eyes we tread on evil ground
with jaded eyes around us each step is scrutinized

where we go from here when our time is done

may they lead you home to where youll live in peace

ill shut myself up and black out the windows

to show you how much she has meant to me

mocking our doomed existence

surrender to visions of a hopeless future
prophecies foretell the end of time
alliance of poisoning hate deployed
implications of a dream that died
visions of violence

foreboding dreams of a world to come

chaotic visions now known to be
haunting images of destiny
ageless hands of a wicked race
malicious fury of hell forged hate

fevered visions forming inside

burning embers fill the sky
transforming those left alive

for its still out there waiting for man
to bring the living to death
whats to stop these ghouls of gore
from eating all our birth
beyond science stands the answer
to which there is no cure
no hidden saving antidote
waiting for this world
were reaching out so please take our hands
were living hell right here on the earth
were crying tears for all our lifelong pains
and screaming out save us from the dead
terror unleashed came without sound
the dead crept out of their graves
horrible creatures returning to kill
as graveyards open their gates
is it pure evil is it a warning
of what the earths to become
is religion the key to end the attack
or will we just die one by one
think to the past at all that man has done
the power of sin and greed its ugly head has shown
and maybe it only serves us right that we shall die today
a morbid lesson to the world for all our evil ways
infection slowly setting in our souls are out of time
the errors of our lust for gain have finally claimed mankind
do we deserve to live
life is fading fast
do we deserve to live
we beg to know at last
do we deserve to live
our lives our fading fast

sunless skies stared at him as he escaped
warned by doctor after doctor but nothing could keep him away
from that which for years had kept him insane
obstinate and keen to seek out all remaining elements pertaining the blemish on
his soul

ran off with a strong conviction that what he had seen was real and not
imagination
he knew it he felt it all those pigs in white scrubs tried to fuck his mind

locked away since that delirious day but now free by choice to once again
rattle the forbidden cage deep in those treacherous woods he found it
a spot on the ground marked with the three pebble stones he once found
he shouldve walked away instead he ferociously began to dig deep

clawing through the dirt and roots unfed desire a resurrection at last shall
spire
with nervously chewed down finger nails kept on delving further down
what he finally found was breathing still breath of the

bodiless sleeper revived tender skull acquired

deformed beyond reason he gently pulled it out of its hole
lips touched tongues played time to do what had remained unique

insurgent abominator wrecker of all shifting prayer
though no one can comprehend its meaning and its act
bodiless sleeper revived
all the knowledge in this head he now possessed to stir from resting
forever since he got caught he knew replacement was the key
tender skull acquired

their bristly chins scraped one another
as he measured between his shoulders
he made a mark at his neckline
where the blunt and rusty saw soon would be placed

closed his eyes and let the jerking motion cut to finally remove the weakness
his head fell off yet still alive his headless body replaced it fast

slowly he worked with a needle and thread to carefully secure the head
connected they fused very well the stitches healed so nicely
this body now wanders around slightly confused but with knowledge like few
under the three pebble stones grave of the head is now empty

music  lyrics by torbjrn weinesj

i see your anger
i see your fear

time will slowly fade away the youth you hold so dear
youre six feet under

and still you breathe

lines that crawl across your face will ruin your faith in what you need

i am the lord your god who brought you out of egypt

out of the land of slavery you shall have no other gods before me
holy father eye to eye teach me wisdom how to fly

holy father mend my wing a touch of heaven you will bring

may be so its clear the way to heaven or is it fear
say the name there is no pain just say the name

time stands still awaiting

one breath controls the ocean
time stands still in silence
lord of all

cash is growing
in paradise
hold your breath and place your bet then just roll the dice

no more excuses

no empty lies
for the one who fooled the world death is singing lullabies

i trade my soul for what you sell

i fill my heart right from your well
you say youre wiser
stories you tell
focused on the credit cards not on heaven and hell

your wish is fortune
your wish is fame
worshipping hearts in search for the meaning
false prophets knows the ways of stealing
treasure hunt in the maze of life
sliced by the edge of the knife

dreamscape in a blanket silvergray
homesick for a memory washed away
all light in our hollow eyes is stardust stardust
once you learn there is no return to lies
heaven cried as we left the earth to die
homesick for a memory
in silent sleep
eternally

bring me to life
bring me the starlight
bring me the sun and moon
release the stars tonight

bring me to life
bring me the starlight
bring me the sun and moon
release the stars tonight

far away in a distant memory
there is lush there is green and you and me
now all blood in our hollow hearts is stardust stardust
washed away like a face drawn in the sand
at the edge of the sea is how we end
painful is the memory
we did it to ourselves

awaken me
bring back my heartbeat
bring back the warmth of skin
the world we were living in

bring me to life
bring me the starlight
bring me the sun and moon
release the stars tonight

bring me to life
dreamscape in silvergray
bring me the starlight
homesick all washed away
bring me the sun and moon
release the stars tonight

bring me to life
bring me the starlight
bring me the sun and moon
release the stars tonight

bring me to life

homesick all washed away

its quest around the sun
mankind on the run
overwhelming indifference
destruction fills my eyes
blue and full of life
wandering through time
being outer space
it looks ya right in the face
the vessel on its way
saving the grace
bright gentle face
a life saving case
propulsion a mistery
science the missing link
but damage they cause
by inventing machinery
inventing my greatest fear
theres so much to discover
blaming each other tomorrow
hurting each other today
fading away
denying the facts
turning the vessel into a wreck
blowing prospect away
not trying to save the day
tomorrow fading away
following time makes me afraid

trapped inside her crystal ball
you feed her the future you tell her all
life and death she feels is in her hands
shes the one who dies by your command

eyes in the crystal
face in the mirror
a voice in the back of your head

smash the crystal
smash the mirror
or the witchs curse will leave you dead

the witch speaks of the dreams youve seen
a divine message of light
if you look into her crystal ball
your future will end tonight

music by vincent bocchini
lyrics by vincent bocchini

in the streets youllfind the people
with the wanting to love
in the streets youll see the mercy
of what life has to give

chorus
a leap of faith is this the one
dont wait to see when its said and done
a leap of faith follow your heart
when loves within it wont depart

its up to us to teach them
theyre out there for us to teach them
we need to gather round
so someday they will be found

ps

waking up screaming by nightmares that haunts me
darkness surrounds me and fills up my soul
people say im dumb
but i just feel numb
cause the madness that fills me
just cant let me be

searching the power to resist
cutting wounds in my wrist
pain in my flesh sets me free
from the pain that isnt me
pain in
pain out

cutting myself
in rage of my mind
misery and blame
is exceeding the pain
yes i feel the pain
but its a pain that i can recognize

feeling life

abhorent strife

a single drop of blood
is pouring from a vein
a wish that it will take
away from me this pain
cause no one understands
this pain in my soul

gods grace is all you need

ive had one desire since i was born
to see my body ripped and torn
to see my flesh devoured before my eyes
im here for you i volunteer as a human sacrifice

chorus
carve me up slice me apart
suck my guts lick my heart
chop me up i like to be hurt
drink my marrow and blood for dessert
eaten my one desire my only wish is to be
eaten the longer i live the more im dying to feel the pain
eaten i would do anything to be
eaten my one desire my only wish is to be
eaten

i finally found you my personal slaughter
as an appetizer i let you taste my daughter
call me sick but this is what i need
my only purpose here is for you to feed

desecrate me
tear me limb from limb
eviscerate me
chew me to death

speak in flames
infliction the devices
resting on the shadows false promises
still
arousing still
separating all of that you feel which still
continues to condemn you for your ways
a thought that wreaks of pain
an act of true emotion
burn the styrofoam remains
multiple incisions
a puncturing of the many senses
a lack of truth evolved
raw defenses
and a portrait of you depth declined
swine apprentice
for one example
the flock was raised in the cold
points of afterbirth suffocate from the cold
and im pouring out my chest leaking in the
freezing cold
heed the chosen words produce manifold
i paid my dues
my hands calloused and ashed
reveal infected wounds and my scabbing scars
caress my broken back

melting thoughts of disintegration
hitting deep her insistence
to mutilate her newborn infants
after giving birth her mind wasnt the same
slowly slipping away a state of mental decay
family now complete
father watches on
as mother dismembers
her newborn son

dissecting the specimen split
i will explore the body wide open
uncover carnage within split wide open
virgin untouched skin
releasing her rage
that dwells inside
tainted blood rushes through veins
her body chemically changed
love was erased on the edge of a butchers knife

the kitchen becomes a makeshift slaughterhouse
every nine months she butchers one more child
reminders of the deceased scattered through the home

bones and skulls of sons and daughters
genitals ferment
in jars inside the cupboards
for father to dissect
no one will discover the murder they commit

children used like laboratory rats
sickening vulgar experiments
she sees what others cant
probing the guts of her fetus
advocation of the pain
mutilating draining veins

witness the horror
offering to themselves
continuing murdering their own kind
never deny this fantasy life they enjoy
addiction to this heightened state
postbirth psychosis
disjointing her own children
form the life theyll never live
a massacre within her soul
struggling for control

as the holocaust horizon victimised the sky
in the bowels of a small town spins a vortex of hell

inject black tar in my arteries

from birth deathbed into the grave

vital organs on the dance floor
gyrating to the beat
as the ghost of the goat head wanders through the street

the dark silouette of the creature
poised crouched on the corner of a cliffs edge
waits eagerly eyes glare patiently
red eyes filled with fire and torment

gleam in the frenzied brightness
across the shadowed vallies below
a crack of thunder breaks the deafening silence
which once ruled the planes the creature is unmoved

by the commotion and the noise and the blinding fork
of lightening which strikes only a few yards from where
lays it wait for something
satan laughs wings spread to magnificent fullness

the creature stands at full glory inhaling deeply
the ice cold air each tender muscle rippling in
the almighty stench of the great dimensional diety
lucifer smiles from the far far west a chariot of fire
emerges travelling at a tremendous speed toward the

creature the creature laughs as if in an immense
state of frenzy the creature leaps up off the ridge
and hollers with dignity in the now cloudless sky
its long red hair blowing freely in the wind

the chariot emerges and with a sharp swift movement
the creature takes the reigns and flies up into the
night howling out immortal cries a prediction
of war

at war with satan

the warriors gather slowly around
the sacred city hell
satan screams a vengeance
on the land as the angels fell

tyrants pray disaster for the
land of love and trust
demons plot a way to turn
the heavens into dust

the standard bearers chosen
from the mass of satans dogs
to hold the flag of hades high
defying all the gods

satan laughs the words of war
the heavens shake with fear
armageddon sings his song
the battles ever near

let the joyous celebrations of hell begin

who holds the keys to the seven gates

lucifers demonic laughter
assist our quest belial prays
free from hell who serves the master
sound the charge on sabbaths day

charge

crest the demons souls
show yourselves in power
angels fear resist
nothing holds the storm

inform the grand master of hades

storm the gates

free from the pits of hell
slaves emerge the mountain
we shall destroy the accursed heavens
advance great legions strong
crush the gates and enter free
our lord of hell must take gods throne
heavenly inferno
spread the message far

take to the skies

come on

frenzied demons  angels cries
lucifer commands the orgy
molten mayhem one thousand lies
heaven fails to hold tranquility

the brides of sin are wed
their price nine holy heads
white marble walls bleed red

fuck the bastards

come on

gods creation  all must see

heavens hell
god has fell
sound the knell

where time and space collide
mortals sit and watch the tide
of angels crashing up against the sacred shore

without the holy grail
only evil can prevail
the church of god cant hide the truth no more
cant see the light no more

light up the skies

the demons ring the sabbath bells
rejoice the witches chant
preper the sacrifice  by fire
the blood runs black through heavens shell
declare the witches dance
nothing shall suffice
the souls of christ

drag him through the whores

alters of the flesh
equinox eternal glory

a new born flaming star

sullen and remorse
tana turns the key of life
to hear the thunder roar

ancients gather amidst the stars
mortals stare in fear
the earth is damned beneath the mist
a veil of angels tears

white clouds of life are turning black
the virgin pure she fears attack

raise for satanic queen

into the womb of utopia spilling forth great streams
of virginal purity and bliss
the golden throne of the tetgrammaton is ablaze
satanic majesty sits proud the joyous drones of celebration

enact scenes of blasphemy lust and destruction
raping the holy trinity the sabbath chimes the tunes of bless
and sanity the heavens in their last throes of death
gabriel and his arc angels falling ever downwards through the

fires of pandemonium to the dark deserted depths of hell
their broken bloodstained wings scorched the by raging inferno
lay battered by the shores of the styx
weary from the battle they seek refuge bathing their wounds

in the blood of a million matyrs while celebration ringing
in the heavens grows strong the keys to the seven gates of hell
lie momenterally unguarded
raging flames carved by the innocence of the angels hearts

will release forth their wealth of centuries of god loving
souls once wronged of their destiny of heavens golden palace
an unseen presence breaths never before pangs of mortal hatred
and anger deep into the pounding hearts of the angels

once more the creature is summoned to deliver a decleration of
war

at war with satan

gabriel screams a vengeance of the
land as the angels fell

land of hate and scorn

it was a calm cool and miserable place
all my friends were under the fire
i could not make out a face
i was trapped with the holiest men
the ultimate punch line to an ironic end
i screamed in my torment and writhed in my pain
as the angels did bathe me with heaven again

there is no earthly way of knowing
which direction we are going
not a speck of light is showing
so the danger must be growing

i draw inspiration from the micro dreams
that twitch the body before the entering
we pull ourselves into a callous induced sleep
swallowed by the years of undigested beatings

in this place you reek of fear
deserved malaise
light is gone with shedding grace
and god has backed away

although i dont hold true the force
a broken core may never mend
but seen have we  that light may end
and dreams are always washed away

escape the pain  for another day
inside this way  and for the norm  call to conform
and on we force the mind  to shine of mother earth
here what is best  to let our mother never rest

can i ever hold the hand
what drought has caught and killed again
always hope for this
always dry is where it ends
enflamed in lust and drive to touch
released from lightness heights
fell did our heart
poured forth at last our buried trust

believeas you seethe anticipation
lost in mourning choirs of devastation
the aimless glow we thought would never cease
now groan out its renunciation

toxic airwaves throwing their corrosion
like patternless meshes over consumed ground
earth blindlystretch out her maimed arms
only to receive the certaintytheres no help to be found

no ones to blame as streams of equality washes away
the last traces of humanitys existence
we just sat like contented denials as abnegation
took its toll in exterminations enhance

we claimed the dead would open the eyes of the living
but whos left to exclaim the wordswe were right
memories of anguish lie as whisper in the heat
only bareness observe the last remains float out of sight

a voyeur in league with the great thief night
in an overthrow of women light
slid in to rob the prayers
she whispered to the air with thin deliberation

spare me from the wolves
clawing past my door
tear me from the ghouls
that start to gnaw my fingers

following her heart
and every beat that spoke
i kissed her risen naked
soft white throat

soft white throat

incense lit at perfections feet
has never burnt so sickly sweet
as the fragrance of her breath
when her lips met death with such imagination

bear me to the moon
the dour toll of bells
scare me with their boon
of winters bitter graveyards

swallowing her fear
i veered beneath her coat
of soft white meat on
soft white throat

crepuscular the lust in her
went supernova
setting maps aflame
before her veins ran colder
and muscular the final thrust
in her spilled over
covering her back
i saw an angel lift her
coma

i fell to eyes
of a bestial past that once
teaching grief through jaded pupils
now shone like celestial glass in hell
in hell

and doused in the glow from her parting gift
never there lay with curves like snowdrifts
a beauty so frozen in bliss
slumped to warm the dead to a standing ovation

spare me from the wolves
clawing past my door
tear me from the ghouls
that start to gnaw my fingers

following her heart
and every beat that spoke
i kissed her risen naked
soft white throat

crepuscular the lust in her
went supernova
setting maps aflame
before her veins ran colder
and muscular the final thrust
in her spilled over
smothering her cracks

grant me the taste of love
one final time lest i should hide
when seraph call me from above

from debt addresses wept

in the eighties i had a radio
i had a real bad haircut
and nowhere to go except aladdins castle and eckerd drugs
she had sweat bands she liked to break dance
she wore a pair of shiny parachute pants
i was geek and she was a superstar
was it just was it just was it just too much to ask
worlds were in the space between us
i guess i shouldve made a sacrifice
or tried to meet her set of standards
i had a pretty good collection of masters of the universe
i had boba fett and greedo and i was pushing seventeen
she had tapes of chaka khan and kenny loggins
she knew how to backwards skate
she had eyes that looked around for the boys
who i had lately grown to hate
at the time i was working on a novel
just another fruitless side distraction
i sometimes wondered what she would think of that
what if i had wowed her with some fiction
over wine and crackers by a lakeside
would she have just stood back up and moonwalked home
was it just too much to ask
worlds were in the space between us
i guess i shouldve made a sacrifice
or tried to meet her set of standards
but she didnt have respect for the stray cats
i didnt have respect for that
